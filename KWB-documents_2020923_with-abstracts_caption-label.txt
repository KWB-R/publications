   abstract = {Eine MBR-Laboranlage (210L) wurde mit zwei verschiedenen Reaktor-konfigurationen zur vermehrten biologischen PElimination (Bio-P) mit kommunalem Abwasser betrieben. Die beiden Reaktorkonfigurationen zeichneten sich neben einer vorgeschalteten anaeroben Zone für den Bio-P Prozess durch eine vorgeschaltete Denitrifikation bzw. eine nachgeschaltete Denitrifikation aus. Beide Reaktor-konfigurationen wurden bei einem Schlammalter von 15 Tagen mit vorgesiebtem (1mm)  Rohwasser parallel zu einer konventionellen Kläranlage betrieben. Für Phosphor wurden sehr niedrige und stabile Ablaufkonzentrationen von 0,05-0,15 mgP/L mit beiden Konfigurationen erreicht. Die Phosphorgehalte der Schlämme lagen bei 2,4-3% P/TS. Während mit der vorgeschalteten Denitrifikation erwartete Ergebnisse von 86-90% Stickstoffentfernung erzielt wurden, erreichte die nachgeschaltete Denitrifikation eine unerwartet hohe N-Elimination von bis zu 96% (ohne zusätzliche C-Quelle). Eine Betriebsphase mit Phosphoraufstockung des Zulaufes (~40 mgP/L) führte bei einer Elimination von 20-25 mgP/L zu P-Gehalten im Schlamm von 67%P/TS. Neben dem Bio-P-Mechanismus waren hier jedoch auch Fällungs- und  Adsorptionsmechanismen für die P-Aufnahme relevant.},

   abstract = {Until around 2004, the term riverbank filtration (RBF) or simply bank filtration (BF, a unified term for river and lake bank / bed filtration) was not commonly used in context to drinking water supply in India. The abundant recharge of traditional dug wells (used for drinking and irrigation) located near surface water bodies (mainly rivers but also some lakes) by very low-turbidity water via natural bank filtration during and after the monsoon has been recognised in India for a very long time. Induced bank filtration has been suggested in the 1970s to address the growing agricultural irrigation demand in the alluvial plains along the Ganga River by inducing recharge from surface water bodies during and after the monsoon (Chaturvedi and Srivastava 1979). Documented evidence till date suggests that induced bank filtration has been used in India for at least 56 years, although even older BF systems may exist. In Nainital, bank filtrate has been abstracted from Nainital Lake since 1956 (Kimothi et al. 2012). BF supplements existing surface and groundwater abstraction for drinking water supply in the cities of Ahmedabad (by the Sabarmati River), Delhi and Mathura (Yamuna) and Nainital (Nainital Lake); on the other hand in Haridwar and Patna (Ganga), and Medinipur and Kharagpur (Kangsabati), BF is used as an alternative to surface water abstraction and to supplement groundwater abstraction (Sandhu et al. 2012). Considering the continuously growing demand for drinking water in sufficient quantities, the emphasis at many BF sites has traditionally been on maximising the volumes of raw water abstracted. Furthermore, the results of a fact-finding study (Ray and Ojha 2005) on the use of BF for drinking water production in India on one hand confirmed that a number of river-side communities have been already using BF for a long time, but that on the other hand only scarce information on the hydrogeological conditions and water quality of these BF sites existed. Holistic investigations on water quality aspects and sustainability (qualitative and quantitative) of these existing BF sites began only after 2004. Water quality investigations conducted at the BF sites of Srinagar by the Alaknanda river (Ronghang et al. 2011), Haridwar and Nainital (Dash et al. 2008, 2010; Sandhu et al. 2011a), Delhi (Sprenger et al. 2008; Lorenzen et al. 2010) and Mathura (Singh et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2012) and Patna (Sandhu et al. 2011b) showed that the main advantage of using BF in comparison to direct surface water abstraction lies in the removal of pathogens and turbidity. The surface water concentration of trace organic contaminants and their removal at the investigated sites has not been widely investigated, but has shown to be high at sites in Delhi and Mathura (Sprenger et al. 2008; Singh et al. 2010). For conventional treatment, high concentrations of organic contaminants requires high (40–60 mg/L) doses of chlorine prior to flocculation thus creating a greater risk for formation of carcinogenic disinfection by-products, as reported in Mathura (Singh et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2012). In such situations BF is advantageous as a pre-treatment in order to reduce the necessary doses of chlorine prior to flocculation. Additional advantages of BF may also be seen during the monsoon season principally in the removal of turbidity and pathogens, as well as in the removal of color and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance, turbidity, total and thermotolerant coliform counts, endocrine disruptor compounds and organochlorine pesticides (Dash et al. 2008, 2010; Sandhu et al. 2011a; Thakur et al. 2009a, 2009b; Sprenger et al. 2011; Mutiyar et al. 2011). BF, however, does not present an absolute barrier to other substances of concern (e.g. ammonium) and some inorganic trace elements may even be mobilized. This has been observed in Delhi which has poor surface water quality (Sprenger et al. 2008), at which extensive post-treatment is applied to remove high levels of ammonium. The objective of this deliverable is to provide an overview of known BF schemes in urban areas of India where the abstraction of bank filtrate is intentional. The main water quality issues of concern are highlighted. Related published and unpublished data, as well as new data collected since the commencement of the Saph Pani project in October 2011, is presented for the BF schemes in Haridwar, Nainital, Srinagar (by the Alaknanda river in Uttarakhand), Delhi Mathura and Satpuli (by the Eastern Nayar river in Uttarakhand).},

   abstract = {Groundwater exploitation in India has increased rapidly over the last 50 years as reflected by the growth of the number of groundwater abstraction structures (from 3.9 million in 1951 to 18.5 million in 1990) and shallow tube wells (from 3000 in 1951 to 8.5 million in 1990) (Muralidharan, 1998; Singh & Singh, 2002).Today groundwater is the source for more than 85 % of India’s rural domestic water requirements, 50 % of urban water and more than 50 % of irrigation demand. The increase in demand in the last 50 years has led to declining water tables in many parts of the country. For example, 15% of the assessment units (Blocks/Mandals/Talukas) have groundwater extraction in excess of the net annual recharge (Central Ground Water Board, 2007). According to Rodell et al. (2009), the extent of groundwater depletion between 2002 and 2008 was 109 km3, which is about half the capacity of India’s total surface-water reservoirs.},

   abstract = {The combined sewer overflow issue in the city of Berlin is becoming an increasing threat to the water quality of the surface water bodies, as the number and volumes of combined sewer overflow (CSO) events occurring per year may be on the rise due to climate variations among other aspects. For this reason, a case study was formulated to investigate the implementation of storage tanks in one of Berlin’s sub catchments, Wilmersdorf, in order to reduce the Occurrence of CSO to a once per year event on average. The investigation was made using InfoWorks Collection system (CS), one dimensional urban planning software used widely for sewer system modelling. The network of the Wilmersdorf catchment (majorly consisting of combined sewers, with small portions of separate rain and separate foul sewers) was modelled with the aid of InfoWorks. The implementation of tanks in the network was divided into two main parts: centralized and decentralized tanks. The centralized tanks addressed the issue of CSO, in order to reduce the CSO occurrence to once per year, firstly by using a short design storms representing a one year return period, to implement initial storage volumes, then this network was validated using rain series records for one year (1990) and for thirty years (1980-2010). The decentralized tanks were implemented at much smaller storage volumes compared to the centralized tanks, in localized locations to solve small surface floods in the separate rain sewer system, or to reduce the pollutant load Biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the CSO, by storing water from the separate foul system in the catchment. The results obtained for the centralized storage tanks show major reductions in CSO, with four centralized tanks implemented in central parts of the catchment. The target of once per year CSO event was achieved for the one year rain series (1990), but not for the thirty years rain series (1980-2010). Results for the decentralized storage tanks show reduction of surface flooding for the studied local areas in the catchment, with sometimes a reduction of surface floods also downstream of the targeted areas. On the other hand, the pollutant load (BOD) was reduced by negligible amounts with decentralized tanks at the studied separate foul system locations, with results showing that the overall BOD load reduction in the overflow volume is also accompanied with CSO overall volume reduction.},

   abstract = {Direct addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) to the inlet of a deep bed filter represents an energy- and space-saving option to remove organic micropollutants (OMPs) during advanced wastewater treatment or drinking water purification. In this lab-scale study, continuous dosing, preconditioning a filter with PAC and combinations thereof were investigated as possible dosing modes with respect to OMP adsorption efficiency. Continuous dosing resulted in decreasing effluent concentrations with increasing filter runtime due to adsorption onto accumulating PAC in the filter bed. Approximately constant removal levels were achieved at longer filter runtimes, which were mainly determined by the dose of fresh PAC, rather than the total PAC amount embedded. The highest effluent concentrations were observed during the initial filtration stage. Meanwhile, preconditioning led to complete OMP adsorption at the beginning of filtration and subsequent gradual OMP breakthrough. PAC distribution in the pumice filter was determined by the loss on ignition of PAC and pumice and was shown to be relevant for adsorption efficiency. Preconditioning with turbulent upflow led to a homogenous PAC distribution and improved OMP adsorption significantly. Combining partial preconditioning and continuous dosing led to low initial effluent concentrations, but ultimately achieved concentrations similar to filter runs without preconditioning. Furthermore, a dosing stop prior to the end of filtration was suitable to increase PAC efficiency without affecting overall OMP removals.},

   abstract = {This document contains the synergies and common activities of five H2020 projects that started in the summer of 2019: The five projects are digital-water.city, Score Water, Fiware4Water, Naiades and aqua3S. The first four were funded by the SC5-11-2018 call and the latter by the H2020-SU-SEC-2018-DRS-03. All these five projects have a common theme: Digital Water, with a variety of case studies and approaches, but also with several similarities in challenges, scope and goals. Following a suggestion by EASME that supervises the SC5-11-2018 projects, the synergies and clustering activities were included in the Grant Agreement of each project, resulting in the contractual obligation to report about them in a common deliverable (this document). Thus a Synergy group was born: DigitalWater2020 (DW2020). DW2020 is organised along four thematic areas/task forces: Task Force 1: Ontologies, Task Force 2: Sensors demonstration, Task Force 3: Business models and Task Force 4: Communication, each with its own task force leader. Additionally a fifth task force (Task Force 0: Management) has been created, to coordinate the efforts and activities overall. This document is the first DW2020 report, in common for all the projects, describing their synergies and cooperation, which started early in 2020 and is scheduled to continue until the end of the projects (and hopefully beyond). It contains a brief presentation of each project, details about the structure and activities of each Task Force, as well the planned events for 2020-21 and the next steps. So far the synergies and cooperation among these five projects has been very successful. It gave to all the chance to interact, to exchange knowledge, to cooperate for specific challenges and to help each other. We are already discussing future steps that will lead to DW2020 being “alive” after the end of the five projects. ; Version (v0.1.0) submitted to EC.},

   abstract = {Treated municipal wastewater may contain pathogenous micro-organisms and persistent trace organics leading to problems when being discharged into the  surface waters. The investigations of the research project PILOTOX aimed at their elimination from treated municipal wastewater through subsequent oxidation by ozone. For this purpose, the TU Berlin (department of Water Quality Control) in cooperation with the Berliner Wasserbetriebe at the WWTP Berlin-Ruhleben, carried out several tests with a pilot plant by the company WEDECO aiming at the ozonation of the effluent. The results show that ozonation is a suitable procedure to remove and transform respectively, substantial quantities of the pharmaceutical residues detected in the effluent of the Ruhleben WWTP and, at the same time, to achieve a germ reduction complying with the threshold values stipulated in the European directive on bathing water. It was found that many trace organics such as the anti-epilepticum carbamazepin or the hormone estron can be removed at a very low ozone dosage to below their analytic detection limit. The X-ray contrast media however, turned out to be more resistant: even at a high ozone dosage, their concentrations could be reduced only partially. In this context, the tests detected that through the combination of H2O2 and ozone, an elevated elimination rate for the substances iopamidol and iohexol can be achieved. The elimination of the analysed trace organics correlated with the decrease of the water’s UV activity. Thus, it is advisable to use the rapidly and simply traceable parameter SAK254 as process control parameter to determine the necessary ozone dosage. In addition, it could be proven that ozonation increases the biological degradability of water components. Laboratory test looking at recontamination levels however, indicate that the threshold values stipulated in the EU directive on bathing water will not be exceeded if the ozone-treated effluent is mixed with water originating from the River Spree. A study regarding the water’s acute and chronic toxicity, to its gene toxicity and endocrine impacts, revealed that – compared to the untreated effluent - no eco-toxicological risk potential can be detected in the ozone-treated water samples.The specific treatment cost covering the large-scale application of ozone treatment at the WWTP Ruhleben range between 1,0 cent/m3 and 2,2 cent/m3, of which the investment costs account for a percentage of 20-30 %.},

   abstract = {The secondary effluent of Berlin's sewage treatment plant Ruhleben was oxidized by dosages of 2.5-22 mg/L ozone and varying operation conditions to remove pharmaceutical compounds and disinfect water in parallel. The majority of analysed neutral and acidic drugs were efficiently removed to the detection limit at ozone consumptions equal to a dosage of < 10 mg/L O3. However, certain compounds like clofibric acid, ketaprofen and traced metabolites required higher dosages of > 10-15 mg/LO3 for complete removal. A series of four iodinated organic contrast media (ICM) persisted the ozone treatment even at high consumption rates. Related to disinfection, the legal requirements (EU bathing water directive) could be fulfilled by a consumption of < 10 mg/L O3. For a combined oxidation by ozone and H2O2 (perozone) higher conversion rates for clofibric acid, naproxen and ketaprofen could be obtained at lower dosage (6 mg/L O3). For two ICM, namely iopamidol and iohexol, this was the case at higher ozone consumption. The removal of adsorbable organic iodine (AOI) > 10% could not be achieved by any treatment. The initial genotoxicity of the secondary effluent was stated by four independent tests. Due to the application of ozone, this genotoxicity was completely removed. The presented results confirm that ozonation can be a suitable advanced wastewater treatment at varying operation conditions to lower effluent concentrations of pharmaceuticals and active micro-organsisms.},

The concentrations of carbamazepine and 17α-ethinylestradiol, for instance, were reduced below their detection limits by use of ozone dosages resulting in a specific ozone consumption of 0.5 mg O3/ mg DOC0. At the same time a good disinfection performance was achieved. The given hygienic requirements of the EU bathing water directive (e.g. 2000 N / 100 ml faecal coliforms) are fulfilled without the formation of bromate (< 10 μg/L). As technical control parameter of the ozonation process usually the residual ozone in the liquid phase or in the off-gas are used. However, at very low specific ozone consumptions, ozone reacts instantaneously with dissolved compounds and can not be detected. Hence alternative parameters should be used for effective operation control. The present paper evaluates the relation between UVA decrease and the removal of different compounds (endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, iodinated Xray contrast media), microbial parameters and bromate formation. The results can be used as a guideline for the control of the oxidation performance at large scale ozonation units.},

Sixty-one Aphanizomenon spp. strains were isolated, morphologically and phylogenetically characterized, and tested for ATX production potential by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). New primers were specifically designed to identify a fragment of a polyketide synthase gene putatively involved in ATX synthesis and tested on all 61 Aphanizomenon spp. strains from L. Stolpsee and 92 non-ATX-producing Aphanizomenon spp., Anabaena spp. and Anabaenopsis spp. strains from German lakes Langersee, Melangsee and Scharmützelsee. As demonstrated by LC–MS/MS, ATX concentrations in L. Stolpsee were undetectable in 2007 and ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 µg l-1 in 2008. Fifty-nine of the 61 strains isolated were classified as Aphanizomenon gracile and two as Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi. One A. issatschenkoi strain was found to produce ATX at concentrations of 2354 ± 273 µg g-1 fresh weight, whereas the other A. issatschenkoi strain and A. gracile strains tested negative. The polyketide synthase gene putatively involved in ATX biosynthesis was found in the ATX-producing A. issatschenkoi strain from L.

Although no additional sources of PSP toxins and ATX have been identified in German water bodies to date, the observed CYN concentrations cannot be produced solely by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, the only known CYN producer in Germany. Therefore, we attempted to identify PSP toxin, ATX, and CYN producers by isolating and characterizing 92 Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Anabaenopsis strains from five lakes in northeast Germany. In a polyphasic approach, all strains were morphologically and phylogenetically classified and then tested for PSP toxins, ATX, and CYN by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and screened for the presence of PSP toxin- and CYN-encoding gene fragments. As demonstrated by ELISA and LC-MS, 14 Aphanizomenon gracile strains from Lakes Melang and Scharmützel produced four PSP toxin variants (gonyautoxin 5 [GTX5], decarbamoylsaxitoxin [dcSTX], saxitoxin [STX], and neosaxitoxin [NEO]). GTX5 was the most prevalent PSP toxin variant among the seven strains from Lake Scharmützel, and NEO was the most prevalent among the seven strains from Lake Melang. The sxtA gene, which is part of the saxitoxin gene cluster, was found in the 14 PSP toxin-producing A. gracile strains and in 11 non-PSP toxin-producing Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi, A. flos-aquae, Anabaena planktonica, and Anabaenopsis elenkinii strains. ATX and CYN were not detected in any of the isolated strains. This study is the first confirming the role of A. gracile as a PSP toxin producer in German water bodies.},

   abstract = {In rural areas, small wastewater treatment plants (SWWTP) are a cost-efficient solution to sewage disposal issues. In Europe, small WWTPs are defined as plants for treating domes- tic wastewater up 50 PE. In Germany, about 2.2 million SWWTPs are in operation or are being installed. In France about 10 to 12 million people are served by decentralised sys- tems. There are many different technical solutions on the market, ranging from artificial wetlands, reed bed filters to activated sludge systems. All systems available on the European market have to meet the EU-Certification EN 12566-3, which regulates a minimum standard of op- eration reliability and purification limits. Furthermore, additional guidelines have to be con- sidered, depending on national and regional specifications. There is still a lack of information about performance, operation reliability and maintainability of the different types of SWWTP under real operating conditions. These parameters are however, of particular importance to both customers and service providers. To fill this gap, during a duration time of 14 month in this study 12 different treatment systems were simultaneously compared and evaluated un- der real operating conditions. The study delivers now detailed information about the perfor- mances of different plant models with regard to purification capacity, effluent values, operat- ing expenditures, sludge treatment etc. The results will be published in a user guide. The study was performed at the Training and Demonstration Centre for Decentralised Sew- age Treatment (BDZ) in Leipzig with a special range of small wastewater treatment plant, already installed at BDZ for training purposes as well as two additional plants, which has been installed there especially for the compass study.},

   abstract = {In combined sewer systems domestic, trade and industrial waste water and in case of rainfall events significant volumes of storm water are collected and transported to wastewater treatment plants (wwtp). In the frame of this study a literature review on the impact of combined water inflow on wastewater treatment and the identification of critical system processes and parameters has been carried out. The objective of this work was to study the possibilities of an optimal charging of wwtps during rain and to analyse in how far those concepts could be transferred to Berlin plants. When the inflow of combined sewage to the wwtp increases, screening waste increases, too. However, this is no problem if the screening capacity is sufficient. In the primary settler the formation of primary sludge increases due to the higher inflow load. Concerning dissolved substances there can be an adverse effect when the highly concentrated content of the primary settler is pushed into the biological tanks. To ensure a reliable separation of the primary sludge a hydraulic residence time of 30 minutes is recommended. In literature, the processes of nitrification, biological P removal and the separation of the activated sludge in the final clarifier have been identified as being most critical during combined water inflow. Usually, effluent concentrations of the critical parameters increase only at the beginning of a rain event. Due to the dilution effect that typically can be observed after a maximum duration of 2 hours the concentrations then keep constant again. The process of biological P elimination can be supplemented by chemical P precipitation to avoid critical effluent concentrations during combined water inflow. In the aerated zone the oxygen content can be regulated to improve P incorporation. In the past, in Germany combined water inflow to the wwtp was limited to 2*Qwastewater+Qinfiltration (according to the standard ATV-A 131, 1991). However, the treatment capacity of wwtps that have been designed according to ATV-A 131 (1991) may exceed this value. According to the standard ATV-DVWK-A 198 an inflow of 3-6 times the average dry weather flow may be possible. In literature it can be found that factors of 3 to max. 4 have been realized successfully. Hence, in praxis the peak factor for combined water inflow is rather in the lower range given in ATV-DVWK-A 198. In Berlin the approach given in ATV-DVWK-A 198 will not be applicable. Since wastewater transport is realised via long pressure mains the dilution by stormwater reaches the wwtps only after 5-10 hours. In contrary to wwtps that are directly connected to a gravity sewer system, this Berlin situation leads to long-lasting disturbances of the processes in the activated sludge tanks and in the final clarifiers. However, it must be mentioned that only few information was available on the behavior of the Berlin wwtps during combined water inflow (mainly inflow data). At some wwtps (Stahnsdorf and Ruhleben) an adapted sporadic increase of the inflow rates during rain may be possible. The “bypass process” and an adapted oxygen regulation may be further interesting options for the management of combined water at the wwtp. However, the “bypassprocess” has not yet been tested in situations with long-lasting (5-10 hours) high load situations. The most important options for the reduction of combined water overflows in Berlin will still be the unsealing of currently impervious surfaces, the reconfiguration of the combined sewer system into a modified system (preventing stormwater to enter the combined sewer), the prevention of stormwater inflow into the sanitary sewers of the separate system and the construction and (real-time) control of storage capacities within the combined sewer system. In the future it would be desirable to charge the Berlin wwtps in accordance to their actual capacities based on measurement information. Thus, an optimisation between combined water treatment (reduction of combined water overflows) and the capacity and resilience of the plant could be realised. Therefore, a system for the assessment of the actual capacity of a wwtp (nitrification, final clarification) would be needed.},

   abstract = {Bei der Planung von Strategien für ein „Integriertes Wasser-Ressourcen-Management in urbanen Räumen" kommt der Berücksichtigung von niederschlagsbedingten Einflüssen auf die Qualität der als Ressource verfügbaren Gewässer eine zunehmende Bedeutung zu. Unter den Gewässereinleitungen aus urbanen Gebieten stellen Mischwasserüberläufe (engl. combined sewer overflows, CSO) aufgrund ihres dynamischen Charakters eine besondere Belastung für die Gewässer dar. Für eine integrierte Modellierung von Kanalnetz und Gewässer werden Mengen- und Qualitätsdaten von der Schnittstelle Mischwasserüberlauf benötigt. Ein Monitoring-Konzept für Mischwasserüberläufe in Berlin wurde im Rahmen des Projektes Monitor-1 vom KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin erstellt. Dieses dient der Vorbereitung einer Messphase im Folgeprojekt Monitor-2. Ein wichtiger Aspekt bei der Planung und Vorbereitung eines Monitorings ist neben der Bewertung möglicher Standorte die Auswahl geeigneter Messtechnik. Hierzu wurden umfangreiche Tests verschiedener Produkte aus dem Bereich Online-Messtechnik namhafter Hersteller an der TU Berlin an einem Versuchsstand analog zur DIN EN ISO 15839 durchgeführt. Mit den Tests sollten Fragestellungen zur Vorbereitung des Mischwassermonitorings geklärt werden. Daher wurde das Hauptaugenmerk nicht auf eine Standardisierung der Tests gerichtet, sondern versucht, die Mischwasseranforderungen nachzubilden. Getestet wurden Sensoren, die auf photometrischer Basis das UV- bzw. UV/VISSpektrum analysieren, sowie ionensensitive Sensoren. Ein Hauptaugenmerk lag dabei auf in situ einsetzbaren Sensoren. Im Wesentlichen wurden die Parameter Ammonium, Nitrat und CSB betrachtet. Für die Messung von Orthophosphat stehen am Markt derzeit keine kompakten Geräte zur Verfügung, daher wurden hier klassische Analysatoren (mit z. T. sehr kompakter Bauform) verglichen. Der Versuchsstand wurde mit Rohabwasser, Flusswasser und daraus hergestellten Mischungen beschickt. Alle Sensoren wurden parallel getestet, so dass eine gute Vergleichbarkeit der erzielten Ergebnisse gegeben ist. Neben Fragestellungen wie Genauigkeit, Ansprechverhalten bei plötzlich auftretenden Belastungspeaks bzw. Verdünnungen und verfügbaren Messintervallen wurden insbesondere die Aspekte Kalibrierung, Reinigung und Handhabbarkeit der Sonden bewertet. Der Einfluss der Kalibrierung wurde insbesondere bei den ionenselektiv arbeitenden Sonden untersucht. Dabei wurde der Fragestellung nachgegangen, wie die Sonden kalibriert werden müssen, um sowohl bei den zu erwartenden sehr niedrigen Konzentrationen im Gewässer als auch bei plötzlichem sprunghaftem Anstieg der Konzentration im Fall des Anspringens des Mischwasserüberlaufes die größtmögliche Genauigkeit zu bieten. Neben der Aufstockung mit Abwasser wurden Ammonium und Nitrat auch mit Chemikalien aufgestockt. Die Fragestellung der Datenerfassung und Weiterverarbeitung wurde mit untersucht. Zur Bewertung der Sonden wurden die Anforderungen in die Gruppen quantitative (=direkte aus den Versuchen bewertbar), qualitative (=Literatur- und Herstellerangaben sowie eigene Erfahrungen) und zusätzliche Kriterien(=Herstellerangaben zu Messeigenschaften) unterteilt. Die Ergebnisse aller Sonden lagen dicht beieinander. Eine wichtige Erkenntnis der Untersuchungen ist, dass die getestete Onlinemesstechnik grundsätzlich für den Einsatzzweck in Frage kommt. Zu beachten sind allerdings die jeweiligen Anforderungen und Hinweise der Hersteller zur geeigneten Platzierung der Geräte. Eine große Bedeutung zur Erzielung der gewünschten Genauigkeit kommt der Auswahl und richtigen Durchführung der geeigneten Kalibriermethode zu.},

   institution = {Alliance to Save Energy},
   url = {www.watergy.org},
   year = {2007},
   abstract = {The term "Watergy" was coined by the Alliance to Save Energy to describe the strong link between water and energy in municipal water systems. The Watergy approach helps cities realize significant energy, water and monetary savings through technical and managerial improvements in water supply and wastewater treatment systems, creating efficiencies that provide consumers with quality service with a minimum of water and energy. Efficiency in the water sector involves both the end use of water - such as efficient toilets, low-flow showerheads and reducing peak demand - as well as efficiencies in the supply of water. This paper focuses on the water supply system itself since in many cities most of the inefficiencies occur before the water even reaches the end user. Watergy principles have been applied in numerous cities around the world, demonstrating that water efficiency measures repay themselves quickly and yield many rewards: improvements in water service, immediate increased water delivery, reduced water and energy consumption, and more revenue for system upgrades and new customer connections. Opportunities abound throughout all stages of a water supply system. The most promising areas for intervention within water supply systems are:  (i) improving the pumping system, (i) managing leaks,  (iii) automating system operations, and (iv) regular monitoring (preferably with rigorous metering of end use). These improvements often pay for themselves in months, most do so within a year, and almost all recover their costs within three years. The pumping system is all important, since every liter of water that passes through the system represents a significant energy cost, a cost that is magnified by every liter lost to leaks. Pumping improvements range from lower cost measures like soft starters for motors, trimming impellers (when pumps are over-sized) and re-winding motors, to higher cost measures like replacing inefficient pumps with efficient ones and installing variable speed drives. System automation saves water, energy and operation costs, improves service, and lengthens equipment life. Automation handles operational functions in real time in response to changing situations. Examples are optimizing pressure in the network, triggering alarms in case of emergency, and turning off pumps. Regular monitoring of the system components, operations, and performance is essential targets. in order to track performance and evaluate it against a set of benchmarks and Incorporated as part of the larger O&M protocol, monitoring is a no- or low-cost efficiency enhancement within reach of all utility budgets. Effective management of leaks can save enormous quantities of water and energy. Leakage rates can be lowered dramatically with automated controls that reduce pressure in the network, especially at night. Pressure management is generally more cost-effective than expensive repairs to numerous leaks in buried pipes. This paper provides a comprehensive overview—suitable to all technical levels—to introduce the reader to the approaches and benefits of Watergy. It is intended for a wide audience ranging from municipal and water utility decision makers, to funding organizations, to technical utility staff who want a solid understanding of what a water efficiency program entails without a high level of technical detail.},

More specifically, it focused on studying the impact of groundwater recharge from the riverbed to the regional aquifer using hydrogeochemical and isotopic data. Significant hydrogeochemical zonation was observed between the northern, central and southern sides of the drain, linked to different mineralization processes and mixings. Northward from the drain, groundwater was mainly brackish (4.1–23.4 mS/cm), due to dissolution of evaporites (halite and anhydrite). Southward from the drain, mostly fresh groundwater was found (from 0.5 to 2.3 mS/cm), revealing notable cation exchange processes. In the vicinity of the drain (central area), mineralization was intermediate (0.7–4 mS/cm) and groundwater showed low geochemical evolution, supposing a distinct origin. Stable isotopes of water (δ18O, δ2H) confirmed that central groundwater was not a simple mixing between northern and southern groundwater masses, but had a significant component of infiltrated surface water from the drain. Potentiometric data supported these findings and confirmed the contribution of the drain to the recharge of the aquifer, setting up a hydraulic barrier between north and south, despite surface water availability limited to the monsoon season and low hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed. This study demonstrates the value of the geochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater to characterize groundwater flow pattern in peri-urban agricultural areas, especially surface water–groundwater interactions.},

Surface water spiked with wastewater was infiltrated at different pore water velocities (PWV) and samples were collected at different migration distances. The samples were analyzed for phages and to a lesser extent for fecal bacteria and enteric adenoviruses. At the PWV of 50 cm/d, at which somatic phages showed highest removal, their mean log10 removal after 90 cm migration was 3.2. No substantial differences of removal rates were observed at PWVs between 100 and 900 cm/d (2.3 log10 mean removal). The log10 mean removal of somatic phages was less than the observed for fecal bacteria and tended more towards that of enteric adenoviruses This makes somatic phages a potentially better process indicator than Escherichia coli for the removal of viruses in SSF. We conclude that SSF, and by inference in larger scale river bank filtration (RBF), is an excellent option as a component in multi-barrier systems for drinking water treatment also in areas where the sources of raw water are considerably fecally polluted, as often found in many emerging countries.},

   abstract = {Die Häufung der Befunde von Arzneimittelrückständen in Oberflächengewässern in Deutschland und weltweit, stellen eine aktuelle Gefährdung der stark belasteten städtischen Oberflächengewässer, als aquatisches Ökosystem und unentbehrliche Ressource zur Trinkwassergewinnung, dar. Als eine der bedeutendsten Eintragspfade in Oberflächengewässer gelten die Abläufe kommunaler Kläranlagen. Grund dafür ist, dass die oft persistenten und bioakkumulierenden Stoffe durch den konventionellen Klärprozess nicht aus dem Wasser entfernt werden können. Auch die verschärften Bestimmungen gegenüber den einzuhaltenden Wasserqualitätsparametern, wie Nährstoffgehalt oder Keimkonzentrationen, die sich aus der Umsetzung der EU-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie sowie der EU-Badegewässerrichtlinie ergeben, können voraussichtlich nur durch die Einführung einer 4. Reinigungsstufe eingehalten werden. Ein steigender Arzneimittelgebrauch, beschleunigt durch den demographischen Wandel, sowie eine geringere Verdünnung des gereinigten Abwassers aufgrund der erwarteten klimatischen Veränderungen, unterstreichen die Notwendigkeit einer 4. Reinigungsstufe mit dem Ziel einer weitergehenden Spurenstoffelimination. Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde in der Firma „Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH“ (KWB) im Zuge der Mitarbeit im EU-Forschungsprojekt „AquaNES“ am Versuchsstandort „Klärwerk Schönerlinde“ verfasst. Die auf dem Betriebsgelände der Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) betriebene zweistufige Pilotanlage besteht aus einer Ozonung sowie einer nachgeschalteten biologischen Behandlung durch zwei parallel betriebene bepflanzte Bodenfilter (BF). Bodenfilter 1 (BF 1) wurde als klassischer Sandfilter konzipiert, das Filterbett von Bodenfilter 2 (BF 2) besteht aus einem kiesigen Lava-Biokohle-Gemisch. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde die Reinigungswirkung der vertikal durchströmten BF bestimmt, verglichen und bewertet. Diese wurde anhand der, zwischen Zu- und Ablauf, gemessenen Differenz verschiedener Wasserqualitätsparameter (WQPM), der Konzentration relevanter Abwasserkeime sowie ausgewählter Spurenstoffe untersucht. Im besonderen Fokus standen dabei die durch die BF erzielbare Spurenstoffelimination sowie der Rückschluss auf die jeweils verantwortlichen Prozesse im Filterbett. Als Grundlage der Analyse wurden die laboranalytischen Rohdaten von 60 Probenahmeterminen, die über einen 20-monatigen Beprobungszeitraum (Mai 2017 - Dez. 2018) bestimmt wurden, verwendet. Zusätzlich wurden eigene praktische Untersuchungen zur genaueren Bestimmung der gelösten Sauerstoffkonzentration im Filterbett der BF unternommen. Es konnte eine zusätzliche Reinigungsleistung der beiden BF gegenüber fast allen betrachteten Parametern, gezeigt werden. Für das Gesamtverfahren aus Ozonung und bepflanzten BF wurde eine Verbesserung für ausnahmslos alle untersuchten Parameter aus den Kategorien Wasserqualität, Mikrobiologie und Spurenstoffe erreicht. Für die untersuchten WQPM: CSB, BSB5, DOC, Nitrat, organischer Stickstoff, AFS und Trübung zeigte BF 2 eine höhere bzw. gleichstarke Reinigungsleistung. Auch die betrachteten Spurenstoffe CBZ, DCF, BTA, MTP und OXP wurden durch BF 2, aufgrund des adsorptiven Rückhalts an der Biokohle, effektiver eliminiert. Nur CLA wurde besser durch BF 1 reduziert. TCPP wurde durch beide BF etwa gleichgut zurückgehalten. BF 1 zeigte dagegen deutlich höhere Effektivität bei der Reduktion aller betrachteten Abwasserkeime (E. Coli-, Enterokokken-, C. Perfringens- und somatische Coliphagen). In den BF wurden biologischer Abbau, Adsorption in BF 2 sowie Filtration als hauptsächliche Eliminationsprozesse ausgemacht.},

   abstract = {Due to intensive aeration in the activated sludge basins, a significant part of the organic matter in the wastewater often expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) is mineralized to the greenhouse gas CO2. Therefore the organic content in municipal wastewater is yet a widely untapped source of renewable energy. The Carismo project vision is to reduce the specific energy demand with a new treatment scheme based on a low energy microsieve separation process and at the same time, increase the specific energy recovery with an advanced separation of the organic fraction which is valorized in a digester. Therefore two treatment schemes were evaluated at lab scale and pilot scale with real wastewater. The raw wastewater contained a high COD concentration of 1000 mg/l. The first scheme treated the raw wastewater with a coagulation and flocculation step before a microsieve separation with a drum filter at 100 µm. The second scheme was similar to the first one with an additional MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) installed upstream the coagulation tank. The specific goal of the microsieve process was to increase the organic carbon extraction rate in scheme 1 to 60–80 %. The Pilot trial results showed an average COD extraction of 73–81 %. The average suspended solids (SS) removal was > 95 %. The soluble phosphorus removal was between 15 % and 70 % depending on the coagulant type and dose. With 20 mg Al/l, the effluent phosphorous concentration was around 2 mg/l. The MBBR upstream increased the COD transfer in the sludge by 3–8 %, but simultaneously the mineralization decreased the yield for the biogas process. This and the additional energy consumption of the aeration speaks against the separation process with an upstream MBBR.},

   abstract = {Enhanced nutrients removal in membrane bioreactors (ENREM) combines enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), post-denitrification without additional carbon supply, and membrane filtration in a relatively compact wastewater treatment process [Gnirss et al. 2003]. Since 2006, a demonstration plant of 10 m³ is serving a peripheral area of Berlin to treat the wastewater of about 250 people, following an anaerobic – aerobic – anoxic process scheme [Gnirss et al. 2008]. Post-denitrification without additional carbon supply is quite uncommon because the lack of carbon as electron donor usually results in low endogenous denitrification rates (DNR) below 0.6 mgNO3-N/(goTS h), leading to larger reactor volumes and thus higher investment costs [Kujawa & Klapwijk 1999]. In contrast to that, the ENREM process showed enhanced denitrification rates of 1−2 mgNO3-N/(goTS h), raising the question which carbon source is used to obtain these rates [Adam 2004; Lesjean et al. 2005; Vocks et al. 2005]. To address this question, several batch experiments were conducted using acetate as reactor feed, which is completely consumed by the biomass within the anaerobic phase. These experiments ruled out soluble carbon sources such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), lysis/hydrolysis products, or adsorption of acetate [Vocks et al. 2005; Bracklow et al. 2007]. The analysis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and glycogen as intracellular carbon storage compounds typical for EBPR systems showed no clear trend for the anoxic phase. Furthermore, the results showed a carbon recovery rate for the anaerobic phase of only 50−70 %, accounting for PHAs, glycogen, carbon dioxide, soluble COD, and acetate. The experiments also showed that the DNR can be increased by adding higher acetate dosages at the beginning of the process [Nicke 2005; Baumer 2006; Stüber 2007]. These observations led to the assumption that an unknown intracellular carbon storage compound might be formed during the anaerobic phase which serves as carbon source for enhanced denitrification [Lesjean et al. 2008; Vocks 2008]. This study was conducted to prove the theory of an unknown intracellular carbon storage compound used for enhanced denitrification and to identify this compound. In-vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has proven to be an adequate tool to analyse metabolic pathways of microorganisms and to identify also unknown compounds [Pereira et al. 1996; Maurer et al. 1997; Jeon & Park 2000; Lemos et al. 2003]. However, NMR requires the use of a single carbon source (monosubstrate) which can be labelled by 13C isotopes. Hence, this study included the adaption of the ENREM process to acetate as monosubstrate in lab scale. A 6 L sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SBMBR) was inoculated with sludge from the ENREM demonstration plant and stepwise adapted to acetate as single carbon source. The reactor was operated successfully for a period of 190 days and showed phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics typical for the ENREM process. Furthermore, carbon mass balances showed the same recovery rates of 50−70 % like in previous studies, and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) showed a high abundance of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), thus indicating a successful adaption of all ENREM process characteristics to monosubstrate. The continuous long-term operation with a readily biodegradable monosubstrate rules out the presence of slowly biodegradable COD (sbCOD) as carbon source for denitrification.
Since in-vivo NMR studies require special equipment and experience, five NMR studies were carried out together with PhD Paulo Lemos at Universidade Nova de Lisboa (UNL). First NMR experiments conducted in a 10 mL NMR tube had to be aborted during the aerobic phase due to agglomeration of biomass at the tube wall. The following two experiments used a recirculation line between a 50 mL sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and the NMR tube in order to stabilize the process by a higher biomass volume and less organic load. Although these experiments reached the anoxic phase, they had to be stopped because denitrification did not appear in NMR. All obtained NMR spectra showed no sign of unknown carbon storage compounds. In contrast to the observations in Berlin, the spectra proved the formation of large quantities of intracellular PHA during the anaerobic phase, which were converted to glycogen during the aerobic phase, hence following the typical PAO metabolism. In consideration of these observations, another carbon mass balance was carried out accounting also for cell-bound EPS and applying a PHA extraction based on chloroform and methanol instead of the propanol digestion used in Berlin. Due to these measures, it was possible to close the carbon mass balance. A direct comparison between the two PHA extraction methods proved that digestion used in Berlin was not appropriate for PHA analysis. Hence, the theory of an unknown intracellular carbon storage compound was disproved, because the unclosed carbon mass balance was the strongest argument for this assumption. However, the results still show increasing DNRs with higher organic load, indicating the use of PHA, glycogen, or cell-bound EPS as carbon source used for enhanced post-denitrification.},

As a result, the number of publications concerning quality, quantity, and type of treatments has recently increased. This review therefore aims to provide a critical overview on the effects, control, and treatment of CSOs in terms of impact on the environment and public health, strict measures addressed by regulations, and the various treatment alternatives including natural and compact treatments.

   abstract = {The study aims at validating the point-of-use investigations on long-term gravity-driven ultrafiltration for a scaled-up system, which could produce drinking water for a community of 100-200 inhabitants using natural surface water. Eawag, KWB and Opalium conceived a membrane-based small-scale system (SSS) which can operate without crossflow, backflush, aeration or chemical cleaning. Equipped with a biosand filter as pre-treatment (not used in South Africa), it is designed to be robust, energy-sufficient (gravity-driven) and run with restricted chemical intervention (only residual chlorine). The containerised unit (10’) requires to be fed with raw water at a 2 m-height (energy-equivalent to <8 Wh/m3). As sole operational requirement, the membrane reactor is to be drained (i.e. emptied) on daily to weekly basis to superficially remove the material retained by the membrane and accumulated in the module. Otherwise, the system, which is only driven by a 40 cm differential pressure head (i.e. 40 mbar), is totally self-determined and autonomous. This report details the validation tests performed at Ogunjini in the region of Durban (South Africa) from February to April 2010: the gravity-driven UF compact unit showed promising results in regards to flux stabilization and flow capacity. The unit was operated in South Africa with Ogunjini surface water and was run with restricted chemical intervention or maintenance (no backflush, no aeration, no crossflow and no chemical). Under South African environmental conditions and with direct filtration of the river water and only one manual drainage of the membrane reactor every weekday, the unit could fulfill the design specification in terms of water production (5 m3/d) as long as the turbidity of the raw water remained in a reasonable level (up to 160 NTU), with a filtration flux typically around 4 to 6 L/h.m² (corrected to 20°C). This value was in the same range as the lab results and was consistent with the first phase results (around 5-7 L/h.m² after biosand filtration). However, the flux dropped significantly to a range of 2 to 4 L/h.m² after a rain event resulting in a turbidity peak over several days up to > 600 NTU. This demonstrated that for variable raw water types with expected turbidity peaks above 100 NTU, a pre-treatment would be required for the system (biosand filter or other). The performance of microbiological tests confirmed the integrity of the membrane and the ability of the system to achieve complete disinfection.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   month = {2013-08-21},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {Various tertiary treatment processes were compared in the OXERAM project, including a polymeric membrane and a microsieve pilot plant which were installed at the Ruhleben WWTP in Berlin and operated for almost two years. To increase the performance of both these processes, pre-treatments with ozonation, coagulation and/or flocculation were tested. In order to optimize the hybrid processes and to develop a control strategy, online monitoring was implemented. After a literature review and lab trials at the Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) during the project preparation phase, two instruments were recommended. An NS500 device by Nanosight was installed in the UF membrane pilot (pore diameter = 20 nm) influent with sampling every 15 minutes before and after the inline coagulation. The particles between 50 and 1000 nm were analysed to evaluate the impact of the ozonation / coagulation or the coagulation alone on the nanoparticles below 500 nm which are most responsible for fouling. For a better reproducibility and quality of the results, samples were pre-filtered by an online metallic 5 µm filter. Particle analysis by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) was obtained to give reliable and reproducible information about the concentration and size distributions of the colloidal fraction in the tested treated domestic wastewater. Correlation between the membrane reversible fouling measured with the help of the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and the concentration of particles between 100 and 200 nm were detected. Online measurements at the pilot-scale indicate that colloid peak concentrations can be compensated for by coagulation with an optimum dose of 8 mg Fe3+/L. Furthermore, a comparison of FeCl3 and PACl demonstrated that the former is more effective in colloid removal in this treated domestic wastewater. Due to the combination of pre-ozonation and subsequent coagulation, a synergy effect was determined as the combined treatments lead to a better particle removal compared to the effect of the single treatments at same dosages of O3 and Fe3+. A combination of 0.5 mg O3/mg DOC0 and 8 mg Fe3+/L leads to a total reduction down to < 5 % of the initial colloid content1. However a direct prediction of irreversible fouling was not possible. This device should be further optimized for its potential to reduce operational costs and lower solid loads and thus fouling on the membrane. A Pamas particle counter device was installed in the microsieve effluent pipe bypass and this measured the particle size distribution continuously by light extinction at a wavelength of 635 nm at 25 mL/min. No pre-treatment was necessary and it was possible to automatically clean the instrument every hour with distilled water or another cleaning solution. Piping and sensor cell maintenance was crucial to improve the quality of the results due to the high potential of the effluent water to post-flocculate. For optimization of the coagulant and flocculant mixing velocity, the particle counter results were more accurate than the turbidity sensor which did not detect any changes in the effluent water quality. The monitoring tool detected the lowest particle concentration for the optimized mixing velocity. However, the particle counter did not provide better information than an online turbidity sensor for other parameters such as the coagulant types or doses. Therefore, while it is recommended to use an online particle counter during the microsieve plant (10 µm) start-up phase to optimize the coagulation and flocculation, for routine controls an online turbidity sensor is sufficient. Moreover turbidity sensors are less demanding in terms of maintenance effort. The project showed that using the turbidity signal to adapt the coagulant dose was very efficient.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2014},
   abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) consumes 20 % of the overall energy consumption in municipal institutions. And 50% of the WWTPs energy consumption is caused by aeration for the activated sludge treatment. Due to intensive aeration in the activated sludge basins, a significant part of the organic matter in the wastewater often expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) is mineralized to the greenhouse gas CO2.Therefore the organic content in municipal wastewater is yet a largely untapped source of renewable energy. The CARISMO project vision is to increase recovery of nutrients and energy, towards energypositive wastewater treatment schemes. The specific energy demand is reduced with a new treatment scheme based on the low energy microsieve separation process (no aeration) and the specific energy recovery is increased with an advanced separation of the organic fraction which is valorized in a digester. Two treatment schemes were evaluated at lab scale and pilot scale with real wastewater during 18 months. The raw wastewater contained a high COD concentration of 1000 mg O2/L. The first scheme treated the raw wastewater of the Stahnsdorf (South of Berlin) WWTP after mechanical pre-treatment and grit removal with a coagulation and flocculation step before a microsieve separation with a drum filter at 100 µm. The sludge was thickened and sent in a digester to produce biogas. The effluent was analyzed and discharged. The second scheme was similar to the first one with an additional MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) installed upstream the coagulation tank. The digester reactor was fed first with the mixed sludge of the WWTP and then with the two sludges produced by the microsieve to compare its performance. The specific goals of the project was to increase the organic carbon extraction rate to 60-80%, and to enhance the biogas production rate per volume of influent wastewater by 50% compared with current nitrification/denitrification activated sludge processes, and to reduce simultaneously the energy demand of the process. Pilot trials results showed a high COD extraction of 70 - 80%. The MBBR upstream increased the COD transfer in the sludge by 3-8%; however, this additional COD extraction was not enough to cover the additional energy consumption of the MBBR. At the end of the project, an energy balance was carried out with the collected data from the pilot trials. CARISMO schemes were completed by post-treatment in a biofilter with methanol dosing to obtain nitrogen removal. The results of the holistic energy balance show that CARISMO schemes can increase energy recovery from raw wastewater via biogas valorization by 76-83% compared to the reference scheme. Both schemes are superior to the reference scheme with a net energy demand of +0.2 kWh/m³. Finally, it can be concluded that CARISMO 1 schemes will lead to an energy-positive and carbon neutral wastewater treatment scheme. To increase the energy balance and avoid the additional methanol dosing for the denitrification, it is recommended to implement advanced process control for WWTP operation, based for example on the nitrate concentration in the treatment scheme effluent. Even with the additional methanol dosing, operation costs (OPEX) of reference WWTP and CARISMO 1 schemes are in the same order of magnitude. The promising results of the CARISMO project pave the way towards a next generation of WWTP. The new WWTP could recover fertilizing substances and other resources. After an advanced carbon extraction, the main stream nitrogen removal / recovery could be done with technologies that do not resort to carbon source for denitrification like deammonification, algae or duckweed treatment, or ion-exchange treatment with zeolites for nitrogen recovery.},

This plant worked the whole time with post-denitrification without carbon dosing. The synthetic wastewater was designed to achieve a realistic COD:TN:TP ratio and tested for long time biodegradability. The eliminations were >94% (COD) and >97% (TP) for both plants. This was within the range of commercial plants, as well as the TN elimination for the pre-denitrification of plant I (>75%). The eliminations of TN for post-denitrification were above 80% for both plants despite the high influent concentrations and the missing carbon source for post-DN. A calculation of the nitrification rates gave values similar to those found in literature (1–6 mgN/(gMLVSS h)). A comparison of the denitrification showed expected rates for pre-denitrification (7.5 mgN/(gMLVSS h)) for plant I. The values (on average 1.8 mgN/(gMLVSS h)) for post-denitrification in plant II were higher than endogenous denitrification rates which are commonly reported as 0.2–0.8 mgN/(gMLVSS h). The rates for post-denitrification in plant I were only slightly higher than endogenous ones (0.9 mgN/(gMLVSS h)).},

   abstract = {This report compiles the results of three consecutive work packages that have been worked on during the Aquisafe II project. The approach developed is based on the previous Aquisafe I project where the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used as an analytical instrument to develop mitigation strategies for N loads and concentrations in the Ic catchment. During Aquisage I we concluded that SWAT should include a wetland function with which the effect of artificially, constructed wetlands on solute N fluxes can be evaluated. Chapter 1 compiles results of an extensive literature review that was made to identify potential wetland routines and processes that can be included in SWAT. The SWAT add-on to be developed should allow to individually test the effect on single wetlands (e.g. in a given hydrological response unit or subcatchment) as well as the effect of multiple wetlands on the landscape scale. We therefore implemented a stand alone version of the new wetland module which is described in Chapter 2. Here we show the general functionality and individual components of the wetland module. The chapter ends with a virtual application of the modules using SWAT outputs copied from the Ic results. Additionally, a Monte Carlo based sensitivity analyses of the wetland module input parameters showed that the denitrification rate seems to be the most constrained parameter for the simulation of N turnover in the new wetland module. A full implementation of the new wetland module is described in chapter 3. Here, the structural embedment of the wetland module in the SWAT architecture is described. To proof the functionality of the SWAT wetland module model runs were compared to the stand alone version to make sure that the module was correctly implemented. We conclude that the SWAT wetland extension is ready to be tested in real world catchments. Such a full test of the SWAT wetland model was planned towards the end of Aquisafe II. However, as data from the wetlands constructed within Aquisafe II were not available in due time, this last test of the SWAT module was possible.},

   abstract = {Brunnen werden seit Jahrtausenden zur Wassergewinnung genutzt. Doch erst seit wenigen Jahren spielt neben der Ergiebigkeit auch die Nachhaltigkeit von Brunnen eine Rolle, da Neubaugenehmigungen immer schwieriger und langwieriger zu erhalten sind. Durch optimale Auslegung des Brunnens und die Wahl des richtigen Standorts wird versucht, eine möglichst lange Betriebszeit zu erreichen. Trotz bester Voraussetzungen nimmt die Förderleistung von Brunnen im Laufe ihres Betriebes ab, das als Brunnenalterung bezeichnet wird. Die Alterungsrate ist abhängig von den geologischen und hydrochemischen Bedingungen, dem Brunnenausbau und dem Betrieb. Mithilfe vorbeugender oder reaktiver Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen wird versucht, die Leistung eines Brunnens möglichst lange zu erhalten oder wiederherzustellen. Die Wirtschaftlichkeit von Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen lässt zum „Lebensende“ eines Brunnens jedoch nach. Dann sollte der Ersatz des Brunnens geplant werden. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist Teil des durch das vom Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) durchgeführten Forschungsprojektes WELLMA, welches sich mit dem Betrieb und der Pflege von Trinkwasserbrunnen zur Optimierung der Leistung und der Wasserqualität beschäftigt. Hierfür sollte eine Methode getestet werden, die die Wirtschaftlichkeit von Regenerierungen eines Trinkwasserbrunnens mittels eines Vergleiches der Steigung der alterungsbedingten Betriebskosten und der Umlage des Gebrauchswertes bewertet. Ist die Steigung der Gebrauchswertumlage größer als die der alterungsbedingten Betriebskosten, lohnt sich eine weitere Regenerierung. Im gegenteiligen Fall wäre es wirtschaftlicher, den betroffenen Brunnen neu zu bauen. Außerdem sollte das wirtschaftliche Minimum der alterungsbedingten Betriebskosten prognostiziert werden, um daraus die Dauer der anstehenden Betriebsperiode ableiten zu können. Die Berechnung des methodischen Ansatzes erfolgte am Beispiel vier ausgewählter Brunnen der Berliner Wasserbetriebe. Zwei der vier Referenzbrunnen wurden aufgrund ihrer regelmäßigen präventiven Instandhaltung mit Wasserstoffperoxid (H2O2) ausgewählt, um zusätzlich deren Auswirkung auf die Wirtschaftlichkeit von Regeneriermaßnahmen beurteilen zu können. Die Berechnung der Referenzbrunnen bestätigte die Praxistauglichkeit des gewählten Verfahrens. Ausschlaggebende Parameter für die Kalkulation sind u.a. die spezifische Ergiebigkeit, die Anzahl der Betriebsstunden sowie die jährliche Abnahme der Fördermenge. Zudem bestätigte sich, dass durch den Einsatz von H2O2 eine Steigerung der spezifischen Ergiebigkeit erzielt wurde, in dessen Folge die Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine weitere wirtschaftliche Regenerierung erhöht wird.},

   abstract = {The MIA-CSO project is currently led by the department “Point and non.point source pollution control of surface water” in the KWB. Its overall objective is to develop a model-based planning instrument for impact based CSO control. To that aim, an integrated monitoring in the river Spree and in the Berlin sewer system will be carried out in order to calibrate two numerical models before they are used for CSO impact assessment. A module shall be developed to allow the statistical analysis of the model results. This module will be based on Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis (UA and SA). The principle of such analysis is to investigate the effects of model input uncertainties on model outputs: UA establishes a mapping of model assumption into model inferences and SA is the study of how uncertainty in a model output can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model inputs. This study focuses on Sensitivity Analysis. First of all, four of the main SA techniques are described and explained mathematically. The first technique is a screening method called the Morris algorithm. This qualitative method allows one to classify the inputs in order of importance. The most important ones can then be selected for further study. Furthermore, this technique gives an idea of the linearity or nonlinearity of the effects for every input. The second technique, based on Regression Analysis, works under the assumption that the model is linear or monotonous. It gives a qualitative indication of the relative effects of each input. The third and fourth techniques, called Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test and the Sobol’ method, aim at calculating indicators of the relative effects of each input, called the sensitivity effects. They work without any assumption on the model and they can traduce the effects of interactions between the model inputs. Using the free software SimLab, three methods are tested in this study: Morris, FAST and Sobol’. They are applied on catchment Berlin XII in Friedrichshain, under the framework of ATV-A 128, a linear, empirical model used for designing storage tanks in combined sewer systems. After a calibration step, rules are expounded in order to define how to use these techniques and how to have reliable results. Then, the Sensitivity Analysis itself is performed for Berlin XII. Among the nine inputs of interest, the Morris screening allows to choose the four most important ones (the CODconcentration in the wastewater, the COD-concentration in the rainwater, the specific water need and the total impervious area). While the five other inputs are considered constant, FAST and Sobol’ are performed and give the exact relative effects of the four inputs. It appears that two inputs are more important than the two others. For these inputs (COD-concentration in the rainwater and specific water need), further uncertainty study should be done and the lack of data should be corrected.},

   title = {Methods for the assessment of diffuse nutrient pollution in rural catchments},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (ii), presenting existing diagnostic methods for agricultural diffuse pollution on a river basin scale. The report focuses on methods with low to moderate data requirements and analytical effort. Generally no numerical models but mostly GIS based approaches have been considered. The described methods were distinguished along two questions: 1. Does diffuse agricultural pollution play an important role in a given catchment? 2. Which areas within the catchment contribute highly to diffuse pollution of the receiving river, i.e. which areas are critical source areas (CSAs)? Question 1 can be answered by using nutrient measurements, mass balance approaches or land use based methods. For most catchments some nutrient measurements and land use data are available, which allow a first assessment whether diffuse pollution could play a role. For question 2, the identification of CSAs, a number of GIS-based methods was found in scientific literature. Since most available methods focus on nutrients and since spatial data on other contaminants, such as pesticides, are typically not available, the report outlines methods for the two critical nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Each method can be looked up separately, as they are summarized in a similar structure. Moreover Table 8 in Appendix G provides a quick overview of all the presented methods. All the described approaches focus on nutrients, as they are a major concern and often in the focus of research projects. In general the presented methods consider three aspects to assess the risk of pollution from an area within a river basin: 1. The source of nutrients on agricultural land is included through fertilizer application, livestock numbers or indirectly via land use. 2. Transport to the river is mainly assessed via soil type, land cover, elevation and distance to the river 3. In addition several methods take retention processes into account during transport to or within the river It is important that different contaminants show different behaviour. For instance, phosphorus is pre-dominantly particle-bound, enters rivers via soil erosion and can be retained by adsorption or plant export. Nitrate, the dominant form of nitrogen, is very well soluble, is lost mostly through leaching and most efficiently retained by denitrification. Consequently, methodologies for the assessment of CSAs for phosphorus and nitrogen were looked at separately. While many promising methods with limited data requirements and analytical efforts were identified in the report, few concepts (such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation for phosphorus) seem to be well established. Most literature concerns specific local or regional case studies. As a result, transferability to other catchments is questionable. The highest potential is seen in qualitative, multi-criteria methods (such as the scoring approach by Trepel and Palmeri, 2002), which can be adapted by the user depending on the diagnostic aim as well as local data availability. In summary, it is recommended to test several of the presented GIS methods on one or two catchments to gain experience in their handling and their transferability.},

   title = {GIS approach to localize critical source areas of diffuse nitrate pollution. Case study on the Ic catchment, France},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {The project Aquisafe assesses the potential of selected near-natural mitigation systems, such as constructed wetlands or infiltration,zones, to reduce diffuse pollution from agricultural sources and consequently protect surface water resources. A particular aim is the attenuation of nutrients and pesticides. Based on the review of available information and preliminary tests within Aquisafe 1 (2007-2009), the second project phase Aquisafe 2 (2009-2012) is structured along the following main components: (i) Development and evaluation of GIS-based approaches for the identification of diffuse pollution hotspots, as well as model-based tools for the simulation of nutrient reduction from mitigation zones (ii) Assessment of nutrient retention capacity of different types of mitigation zones in international case studies in the Ic watershed in France and the Upper White River watershed in the USA under natural conditions, such as variable flow. (iii) Identification of efficient mitigation zone designs for the retention of relevant pesticides in laboratory and technical scale experiments at UBA in Berlin.The present study focused on (i) and aimed at testing GIS approaches for the localization of critical source areas (CSAs) of diffuse NO3- pollution in rural catchments with low data availability as a basis for the planning of mitigation measures. We tested a universal GIS-based approach, which is a combination of published methods. The five parameters land use, soil, slope, riparian buffer strips and distance to surface waters were identified as most relevant for diffuse agricultural NO3 - pollution. Each parameter was classified into three risk classes, based on a literature review. The risk classes of the five parameters were then averaged in a GIS overlay in order to find areas with highest risk. The Ic catchment in Brittany, France, served as a study site to test the applicability of the chosen approach. The result of the overlay was compared (a) with measured NO3 - loads in seven subcatchments of the Ic catchment and (b) with the results of a previous analysis by the numerical model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Regarding (a) it was found that higher mean risk classes in a subcatchment correspond with higher measured NO3- loads. However, due to the small number of data points a reliable statistical analysis was not possible. Regarding (b), the plotting of the loads predicted by SWAT against the mean risk class for the 32 SWAT subcatchments show a similar, but poorer relationship. The GIS approach was further analyzed regarding its sensitivity to each of the parameters. The analysis showed that the method is not very sensitive to most of the parameters, i.e. risk class distribution (or the choice of CSA) does not change greatly if one parameter is omitted. Nevertheless, if data quality for some parameters is known to be low, sensitivity of the result to the parameter should be considered in addition.In summary, it can be stated that the applied GIS overlay is a promising, easy to handle approach. First experiences on the Ic catchment indicate that GIS-based approaches can be robust, even for lower data availability. As a result, further work is suggested towards developing a universally applicable GIS method for nitrate CSA identification. Main points to be assessed are the number of classes, the necessary weighting of parameters and the best inclusion of different nitrogen pathways between field and surface water.},

   title = {Continuous Monitoring of Combined Sewer Overflows in the Sewer and the Receiving River: Return on Experience},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2012},
   abstract = {This report presents practical field aspects gained during two years of monitoring with state-of-the-art spectrometers and ion-selective sensors, combining (i) continuous measurements of the quality and flow rates of combined sewer overflows (CSO) with (ii) continuous measurements of water quality parameters within the urban stretch of the River Spree. It describes the set-up and the implementation of the monitoring and evaluates the outcomes and experiences towards “lessons learnt”. The challenge of CSO monitoring is their event-based and highly dynamic nature during rain events. Applied online sensors allow dynamic measurements of CSO and water quality impacts for a wide range of parameters. However, the success of online monitoring campaigns depends highly on three main considerations. Firstly, the representativity of the measurement station. The location of the probe must be representative of the concentration over the entire cross section of the sewer or the river. Further criteria have to be considered for the selection of the monitoring sites (e.g. easy access to the probes for maintenance) (chapter 2). Secondly, the quality of the raw measurements. External conditions can influence the quality of measurements and lead to wrong values or outliers. – To avoid drifts, probes need to be cleaned and checked regularly. We found that monitoring stations must be visited at least once a week for functional check-ups. During the two years of monitoring, the maintenance methodology have been continously improved to ensure the best measurement conditions (chapter 3). – But even under state-of-the-art operation of the probes, some values can be affected by errors and lead to misinterpretation. Thus, a validation step is required to detect wrong values and separate them from valid values. Given the large amount of data, an Access-based tool has been developed to support semi-automatic validation of monitoring data (chapter 4). Lastly, the calibration of raw measuments and the determination of uncertainties is critical. Online probes were not able to provide accurate measurements without being calibrated to local conditions with parallel laboratory measurements (online probe refers in this document to spectrometer and ISE-Probe). A Monte-Carlo method was adapted to perform regressions between raw measurement and lab values, which allows considering both uncertainties of sensor and lab chain. For instance, total uncertainty of the UV/VIS probe was between 15 and 30% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), accounting for errors from sensor, laboratory and field (representativity of site). The uncertainties in concentration and flow measurements lead to an uncertainty in CSO COD load between 20 and 70%, depending on the average concentration and flow of the event (chapter 5). In order to gain grab samples and provide high quality calibration, an automatic sampler has been installed at the sewer monitoring. However, for operational purposes, a sewer operator will expect to gain quality online data without the effort and costs of sampling each CSO. In order to estimate the optimal sampling effort, we investigated how many events (or how many lab measurements) are necessary for calibration depending on aimed at uncertainty. From a set of 12 sampled CSO events, we simulate all possible random combinations of events and calculated each time the resulting measurement uncertainty (chapter 5.5). Results shown in Figure A indicate that at least 7 random events need to be sampled to calibrate the probe reducing uncertainties of COD measurement under 30%. It has to be noted that the concentration range of the grab samples has a high influence on the quality of the calibration. A similar analysis considering only events with high lab variations (range > 500 mg/l) showed that then only 4 events must be sampled to reduce uncertainty under 30%. Considering these results, we recommend parallel short sampling campaigns with autosamplers (grab sampling) for application of spectrometers for CSO monitoring. If the lab measurements cover the entire range of water quality variations, a minimum of 3-4 rain events should be sampled to build an accurate calibration function with acceptable uncertainty. If sampled concentration range is exceeded by later measurements, new sampling campaigns should be planned. Since both sensor and autosampling results were available, CSO COD loads have been calculated using both spectrometer and lab values (chapter 6). Results indicate that load calculated with lab samples are within the error range of the loads calculated with spectrometer values. However, the frequency of grab sampling should be less than 10 minutes, to match concentration peaks and quick quality variations in our case. For the purpose of CSO load calculation, autosampler-based monitoring remains a cost-effective alternative to online probes. For a dynamic description of CSO (pollutant sources, mass/flow balance, etc.), autosampler-based data are limited by the minimal sample frequency and the sampling capacity. Investment and effort of online monitoring can overcome these limitations. For river monitoring, online probes enable measuring water quality variations with an acceptable uncertainty, if the probes are properly calibrated. Here, autosamplers are clearly limited by their sampling capacity as the impacts are spread on several days in the case of the River Spree. Since no autosampler was available during the two monitoring years no clear correlation could be established for the spectrometer parameters (TSS, COD, BOD). As the manual approach often fails to catch CSO impacts, an autosampler has been purchased for the last monitoring year in 2012. For NH4 + measurement, the ISE probe has been successfully calibrated performing monthly NH4 measurements in a bucket of river water spiked with ammonium standard solution to reach values in the range expected during CSO (1-2 mg/l).},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   number = {Report D1.3},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {The asset management practices of 19 European cities, municipalities associations or regions have been surveyed using a questionnaire developed by KWB (Appendix A and B). Goals of the questionnaire were to describe current asset management practices in European cities and to identify improvement needs in the definition of inspection and rehabilitation strategies. This initiative is part of the research project SEMA financed by Veolia Eau (duration 30 months from 10.2012 to 03.2015). SEMA aims to investigate the pertinence of sewer deterioration modeling to support the definition of inspection and rehabilitation strategies. Results of the survey describe the current goals and strategies implemented by utilities to inspect their sewer network and plan rehabilitation programs. Ideal goals and strategies have also been asked to the utilities to highlight the brakes and obstacles that may restrain the efficiency of the current strategies. According to the participants (utility managers), the main goals of CCTV inspection programs are to analyze sewer dysfunctions (e.g. collapses, infiltration, blockages, customer complaints, odors etc.) and to satisfy the contract and objectives set with the municipality (e.g. annual rate of CCTV inspections). However, for 60% of the cities consulted, ideal goals should be to find the general condition of the system and to a lesser extent to identify sewer in worst conditions. Identified main limitations for the improvement of CCTV programs are (i) the cost of CCTV, (ii) the reduction of budget in public services delegation contracts, (iii) the lack of data and tools to identify sewers in poor condition and (iv) the lack of priority from municipalities for sewer asset management. It came out that visual inspection data and sewer characteristics are not systematically analyzed to propose more efficient strategies. If CCTV data and the associated knowledge are not valued, municipalities may not perceive the interest to increase inspection expenses. Data knowledge should be enhanced to demonstrate to the municipalities what the benefits of inspection programs are. These general statements hide some regional contrasts. According to the German utilities, CCTV programs are mostly limited by inspection budgets but rarely by the lack of condition data or tools. French and Eastern European utilities acknowledge that inspection programs are limited by budgets but strongly underline the need to collect data and develop tool to support the definition of inspection strategies. This difference can be explained by the German regulation framework. Local regulations commit sewer operators to inspect their network regularly so utilities have generally a better knowledge of the system condition than French and Eastern-European utilities. Regarding sewer rehabilitation (replacement, renovation and repair), strategies aim (i) to avoid the general degradation of the system and (ii) to limit operational costs and nuisances (e.g. odors) linked to sewer dysfunctions. Current rehabilitation strategies are strongly influenced by the programs of other municipal services (especially road construction works), by the main operational dysfunctions (blockages, sedimentation, odors, etc.) and limited budgets. Utilities highlight the difficulty to rank sewer rehabilitation priorities and to use available CCTV data for the planning of middle and long-term rehabilitation strategies. Main limitation is due to the only partial knowledge about the system condition (in most cities only a percentage of the entire system has been inspected) so no information is available on the non-inspected parts of the system. Other limitation is the lack of tools to evaluate CCTV data and use the available knowledge for strategic planning. This aspect seems to be less critical for German utilities that already have an extensive knowledge about the condition of their sewer systems.},

   abstract = {Insufficient public and municipal investment represent a major challenge for the long term management of urban drainage systems. Utilities are challenged to develop efficient rehabilitation strategies in order to maintain the level of service. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspection is used since the 1980’s as industry standard for sewer investigation system and structural performance evaluation. Due to budget restrictions, inspection rates are generally low and municipalities tend to inspect only a small part of their network (e.g. in France, less than 5% according to Ahmadi et al., 2014c). Since the definition of rehabilitation strategies is limited by the lack of information about sewer condition and remaining life, deterioration models have been developed to forecast the evolution of the system according to its current and past condition. One of the main factors hampering the uptake of deterioration modelling by utilities is the lack of real scale evidence of the tangible benefits provided. In particular, most utilities are concerned by the minimum amount of CCTV data required and the relevance of using such models on their networks with limited data availability. Finally, most utilities acknowledge the uncertainties in the procedure of sewer condition assessment, mainly due to the subjectivity of the coding operator. There is a strong need to quantify precisely the uncertainty of the sewer condition assessment procedure and its influence on the outcomes of deterioration modelling. The thesis aims at addressing these gaps by assessing the performance of sewer deterioration modelling using a case study with high CCTV data availability and by identifying the influence of CCTV data quality and availability on modelling performance. The study has been performed with a statistical (GompitZ) and a machine learning (Random Forest) deterioration models using the extensive CCTV database of the cities of Braunschweig and Berlin in Germany. Our results show, that at network level, both machine learning and statistical models can simulate with sufficient accuracy the condition distribution of the network, even in case of low data availability. At the pipe level, the machine learning model outperforms the statistical model. Regarding CCTV data uncertainty, our results highlight that the probability to inspect correctly a pipe in poor condition is close to 80-85% and thus the probability to overestimate the (good) condition of the pipe is close to 15-20% (False Negative). The impact of the uncertainties on the prediction of a deterioration model is not negligible. The analysis shows that the required replacement rate to maintain a constant proportion of segments in poor condition is underestimated if the uncertainties are not included in the analysis.},

A continuous integrated monitoring, using state-of-the-art on-line sensors, was started in Berlin in 2010. It combines (i) continuous measurements of water quality and flow rates of combined sewer overflows (CSO) at one main CSO outlet and (ii) continuous measurements of water quality parameters at four sites within the urban stretch of the receiving river. UV-VIS probes provide continuous measurements of parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) with relatively low uncertainties (10-30%). However, experience shows that on-line UV-VIS probes are not able to provide accurate measurements of water quality without being calibrated to local conditions. Several methodologies to analyze on-line CSO and river measurements are presented and illustrated with an exemplary event. Results show that reliable information such as the CSO load, the proportion of wastewater in CSO, the contribution of wastewater to CSO load, the first flush effect and the intensity of river impacts can be gained at high precision and temporal resolution. Given the broad range of high quality information from CSO impacts in the river to the characterization of CSO emissions, the study suggests the use of continuous integrated monitoring programs to support decisions on CSO management.},

Our study aims to address this issue by developing a set of clearly understandable metrics to assess the performance of sewer deterioration models from an end-user perspective. The developed metrics are used to benchmark the performance of a statistical model, namely, GompitZ based on survival analysis and Markov-chains, and a machine learning model, namely, Random Forest, an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. The models have been trained with the extensive CCTV dataset of the sewer network of Berlin, Germany (115,258 inspections). At network level, both models give satisfactory outcomes with deviations between predicted and inspected condition distributions below 5%. At pipe level, the statistical model does not perform better than a simple random model, which attributes randomly a condition class to each inspected pipe, whereas the machine learning model provides satisfying performance. 66.7% of the pipes inspected in bad condition have been predicted correctly. The machine learning approach shows a strong potential for supporting operators in the identification of pipes in critical condition for inspection programs whereas the statistical approach is more adapted to support strategic rehabilitation planning.},

Even when using very few data (≈3%, i.e. 1000 inspections) to calibrate the model, very good model performance can be obtained.},

   abstract = {Several infrastructure studies highlight the ongoing deterioration of critical assets in water and wastewater systems (WERF, 2007). A recent survey among 397 water and wastewater industry participants in the U.S.A. and Canada highlights that aging infrastructure and the management of capital and operational costs are the two main industry issues (Black and Veatch, 2013). From the participants, more than 70% of municipalities and utilities have already implemented condition assessment and inspection programs to assess the condition state of their systems. However, less than 10% are currently using simulation tools to support their asset management strategies. These results underline the strong opportunity for municipalities and utilities to increase the efficiency of their asset management programs by extracting the value of their (already) available data. Several modeling approaches are now available but not commonly used by sewer operators to support strategies (Caradot et al., 2013). Indeed, most of these models still fail to show that they can adequately forecast future conditions (Ana and Bauwens, 2010; Scheidegger et al., 2011). This article presents an assessment of the ability of sewer deterioration models to simulate the condition distribution of sewer networks. The analysis has been done using the extensive CCTV dataset of a German city, Braunschweig.},

It combines (i) continuous measurements of the quality and flow rates of CSO at one main CSO outlet downstream of the overflow structure and (ii) continuous measurements of water quality parameters at five sites within the urban stretch of the receiving River Spree. The first monitoring results show that continuous water quality measurements in CSO outlets and at downstream river stations are possible at high accuracy, even for comparably complex parameters such as chemical oygen demand (COD). Analysis of measured data confirms the significance of CSO discharges on receiving waters and underlines the value of continuous measurements in describing the local dynamics of the CSO and their impacts on water bodies.},

The effort and associated sampling costs to gain more than 15-20 samples are much less effective, since load and concentration uncertainties remain relatively stable with an increasing number of samples used for the calibration.

The influence of local calibration on the quality of on-line COD measurements of wet weather discharges has been assessed. Results underline the need to establish local calibration functions for both UV-VIS spectrometers and turbidimeters. It is suggested to practitioners to calibrate locally their probes using at least 15-20 samples. However, these samples should be collected over several events and cover most of the natural variability of the measured concentration. For this reason, the use of automatic peristaltic samplers in parallel to on-line monitoring is recommended with short representative sampling campaigns during wet weather discharges. Using reliable calibration functions, COD loads of CSO and storm events can be estimated with a relative uncertainty of approximately 20 %. If no local calibration is established, concentrations and loads are estimated with strong errors questioning the reliability and meaning of the on-line measurement. Similar results have been obtained for TSS measurements.},

   abstract = {A suite of predictive quantitative models of phosphorus (P) dynamics in Lake Tegel and Schlachtensee has been developed. The results, specific to each lake, are set out below, together with general conclusions about management strategies, and some high priority areas for future research. Lake Tegel:  1. The inflow from the Havel to Lake Tegel has been estimated using both a discrete time step box model and a time integrated numerical model. There is good internal agreement between the 2 estimates of the Havel inflow as a mean fraction of the total inflows (~ 40 %) , as well as with the earlier work of Ripl (1993). The estimated residence times agree closely (~ 70 d). 2. There is considerable inter-annual and inter-seasonal variation in Havel inflows. The numerical model can be used to satisfactorily predict these as a function of the Havel discharge, OWA discharge, and water extraction (bank infiltration and recharge, r²=0.76). 3. Over the past 15 years Lake Tegel has been both a net source (1984-1992;2000-2002), and a net sink (1993 – 1999), for phosphorus. The Havel inflow is the most important component in the P budget of Lake Tegel. When the sediment is a source, the modelled internal P load is 2-4 fold of the OWA annual load. 4. The internal P load can be satisfactorily modelled (r²=0.72) as a function of the external P loads, the water works extractions, and the temperature and nitrate concentration in the hypolinmion. The sensitivity analyses indicate that temperature is the major controlling factor for the P release. The significance of nitrate has to be explored further, and identifying thresholds for parameters which trigger release remains to be done in years 2 and 3. 5.The sediment investigations indicate that the sediment P release is dominated by mineralisation, plus desorption at times of high mineralisation and FeS precipitation. 6. Sediment investigations indicate that artificial oxidation of the sediment surface will only impact on P release when the mineralisation is intense and sulphate reduction is prevented. 7. The internal store of mobilizable P in the sediments is small, the rate of mobilisation is high, and the water residence time is short; thus the internal P load will have no long term effects after the external load is reduced sufficiently (< 5 years, assuming an external load of zero). At present, the external P load is high enough to recharge the sediments. Schlachtensee: 1. The water balance of Schlachtensee can be modelled satisfactorily (r²=0.89) by considering precipitation, storm water discharges and a term to reflect groundwater flows, which yet needs to be validated. 2. Groundwater inflows, as unknown parameter, were determined from modelling by a constant groundwater inflow plus other variable components dependent on precipitation, the level of Schlachtensee, the extraction at Well Rehwiese and of the temperature; this still needs to be cross-checked with a more detailed analysis of groundwater data. 3. The long time development of the P concentration is dominated by the reduced external load from the OWA Beelitzhof. The modelled long term steady state is about 0.02 g P m3 (annual mean). Schlachtensee has been a sink for P since 1985. 4. Next to effects of the reduced external load, the P concentration in Schlachtensee is characterised by peaks occurring in autumn and winter. The cause is not conclusively identified, but is suspected to be due to loading from the steep shoreline, e.g. leaching P from fallen leaves or mobilisation of animal/human excreta deposited in the summer. 5. Modelling shows that in Schlachtensee the epilimnion exerts a dominant effect on the P dynamics. Although P accumulation occurs in the hypolimnion, this is only a small fraction of the total lake P content. P release is controlled mainly by temperature and redox conditions, as well as the hydrological regime. Whether or not thresholds for release can be identified from any of these remains to be investigated. 6.The sediment investigations indicate that the sediment P release is dominated by desorption due to FeS precipitation. 7. The internal store of mobilizable P in the sediments is small, the rate of mobilisation is moderate, and the water residence time is longer than Lake Tegel. Thus, though its contribution to the lake’s P pool is much smaller, the internal P load will continue to exert an effect for longer than in Lake Tegel after the removal of the external load. Assuming the external load to be zero, the mobilizable P-Pool will be released in about 5 years. Both lakes: Chlorophyll-a data is used to depict the reaction of phytoplankton biomass to reduced in-lake TP concentrations. Chlorophyll-a were recalculated without the phaeophytin correction, and investigations for TP thresholds that govern phytoplankton response were begun. TP thresholds in Lake Tegel appear to be higher (around 100 μg/L) than in Schlachtensee (around 30 μg/L). Further data evaluation, including analysis of monthly means and individual sampling dates, is needed. Management implications: 1. Lake Tegel and Schlachtensee have quite different behaviours and require different management strategies. The various models already developed provide a basis for exploring adapted management scenarios. An initial exploration has identified potentially effective strategies. 2. For Lake Tegel the results strongly point to the continuation of the current management strategy to limit the inflow of P rich Havel water into Lake Tegel, i.e. increasing the OWA discharge during summer, when the P concentration in the Havel, and the extraction by the Water Works, are at their highest. 3. As the P release from the sediment in Lake Tegel is mainly driven by the temperature above the lake bottom the stratification stability should be as high as possible.Therefore, operation of the aerators in a fashion to maintain the maximum possible stratification in summer is proving critically important. 4. The model results confirm that for Schlachtensee the P balance is no longer dominated by the inflows from the OWA Beelitzhof, thus any further efforts to reduce P loading will be more effective if concentrated on the other major external sources. 5. The dominant term in the P balance of Schlachtensee appears to be the autumn and winter deliveries, though the actual mode of delivery is still unclear. Identifying the source(s) is an important future research task. 6. Epilimnetic processes are dominant in Schlachtensee and thus no further measures are required to reduce the internal P loading from the sediments to the water column. Future Research Goals 1. Improving the P models for both lakes, for Lake Tegel particularly for the calculation of the internal loads and for Schlachtensee for calculating the external loads, 2. Developing the P models towards management models for both lakes by improving the calculation of the internal loads for Lake Tegel and the external loads for Schlachtensee, 3. Including model components for biological interactions and interfacing them within a transferable P process model to explain the process of trophic recovery, 5 4. Using the improved models for assessing the relative effects of external and internal measures aimed at modifying the P budget, e.g. seasonality of OWA output, aerator operation and seasonal changes in water residence time, 5. Analysing which responses of the lake components are continuous and which show thresholds, and identifying threshold values for the latter; in a second step including other lakes using literature and data provided by other partners, 6. Conducting specifically targeted field investigations to fill gaps, to validate the models and as supplement of monitoring by ILAT in order to uphold the long-term data series, as detailed in the proposal for continuation of the project; 7. Using the outcomes of 1 – 6 for optimised management scenarios for the two Berlin lakes. Together with the evaluation of literature and data from other lakes undergoing trophic recovery, general guidance on managing restoration and predictions of responses to reduced nutrient loading will be developed.},

   institution = {Veolia Water Technologies Sweden - AnoxKaldnes},
   year = {2018},
   abstract = {POWERSTEP aims to demonstrate energy-positive wastewater treatment, which requires the utilization of the internal carbon in the wastewater to produce biogas. An increased carbon extraction for biogas production challenges conventional nitrogen removal, in which denitrifying bacteria depend on an easily accessible source of carbon. Hence, POWERSTEP focuses on novel concepts for nitrogen removal in the mainstream line, with a minimum requirement of carbon. Within work package (WP) 2 of POWERSTEP, Mainstream nitrogen removal, three different tasks have been performed that represents three different options for nitrogen removal after advanced carbon extraction. In task 2.1 Advanced control strategies, it was demonstrated in Case study Westewitz WWTP that, with an advanced control system where polymer addition in the primary treatment was based on minimum carbon source requirement for denitrification, a high degree of carbon extraction could be achieved while still meeting the effluent demands for nitrogen, utilizing the conventional nitrification-denitrification pathway. In task 2.2 Mainstream deammonification, the concept using a specific group of autotrophic bacteria, commonly referred to as anammox bacteria, for removal of ammonia to nitrogen gas was demonstrated in full scale prototype in Case study Sjölunda WWTP. Since anammox bacteria are not dependent on carbon for nitrogen removal, the full potential of carbon recovery for biogas production can be reached. In task 2.3 Mainstream duckweed reactor, the potential of using duckweed for high production of vegetal organic biomass for biogas production and simultaneously achieve nitrogen removal, was demonstrated in Case study Westewitz WWTP. This deliverable provides a guideline, where the different options to remove nitrogen within municipal wastewater after advanced carbon extraction are presented based on the performed tasks in WP2 of POWERSTEP, and in comparison with conventional processes. Special emphasis is made on resources (energy, footprint, chemicals) and performances (removal stability, flexibility, sludge production). The outcome from POWERSTEP (tasks 2.1.-2.3) and comparisons with conventional processes showed that in order to meet the full potential of carbon recovery and turning the wastewater treatment plant truly energy positive while still meeting high nitrogen removal requirements, there is a need to implement anammox removal technology. However, the full scale demonstration showed that even if the potential is clearly there, the technology is not yet mature enough to be commonly implemented during cold (<15°C), diluted (low NH4N concentrations) and unfavourable (high) COD to N conditions in the wastewater, why further full scale demonstrations are highly recommended. Under more favourable, and especially warmer wastewater conditions, the anammox technology is today ready for the early frontrunners. Finally, the power of an advanced control strategy for conventional nitrification and denitrification should not be underestimated. With an optimised extraction of primary organic carbon, a large increase of biogas and energy recovery can be obtained without jeopardizing the nitrogen limits. This strategy is ready for implementation and should be evaluated on all wastewater treatment plants.},

   abstract = {Numerous papers have been published studying the causes of fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and searching for a universal fouling indicator. Unfortunately, as these studies were performed using various set-ups and operating conditions (different membranes, sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic conditions and diverse feed wastewaters, etc.), the results in terms of fouling rates and the infl uence of individual parameters rarely match up. In order to obtain a signifi cant database of comparable results from different plants, an intensive monitoring campaign of four MBR systems started in 2007 in Berlin. In these units, 14 parameters were monitored on a weekly basis over 10 months to characterise the mixed liquor and the corresponding permeability, including the novel parameter transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), which represent a specially sticky fraction of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). By performing statistical analyses it was demonstrated that there is no unique fouling indicator, and origins of fouling must be searched in the combination of several parameters using multivariable analysis. Applying a multiple regression the critical fl ux values could be correlated with four parameters (temperature, nitrate, bound and soluble TEP) measured in the activated sludge for 95% of the data.},

   abstract = {A continuous monitoring, using UV-VIS spectrometers, was carried out in Berlin from 2010 to 2012. It combined (i) continuous measurements of the quality and flow rates of combined sewer overflows (CSO) at one main CSO outlet downstream of the overflow structure and (ii) continuous measurements of water quality parameters at five sites within the urban stretch of the receiving River Spree. Locally, the collection of data aims at (i) characterizing CSO emissions, (ii) assessing the local dynamics and intensity of CSO impacts on the river and (iii) calibrating sewer and river water quality models being part of a planning tool for future CSO management in Berlin (Riechel et al., 2011). UV-VIS spectrometers are in-situ probes, which measure absorbance spectra ranging from UV to visual wavelengths. Concentrations, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), are calculated from these spectra. Due to the varying composition of waste and river water a local calibration is required to enhance the measurement quality. According to Gamerith et al. (2011), manufacturer global calibration can lead to systematic error up to 50% for COD measurements.},

   abstract = {A new method for the assessment of the filterability in membrane bioreactors was tested for five months in four MBR units in Berlin. The new method BFM (Berlin Filtration Method) for filterability assessment uses a small membrane filtration test cell which can be submerged directly in the biological tanks to determine the filterability of the activated sludge in-situ. The test cell contains an aerated flat-sheet membrane which operates at similar conditions as in the plant. Filterability is expressed in terms of critical flux obtained by performing flux-stepping experiments. The ultimate goal of monitoring the filterability with the device is to detect in real time fouling occurrences due to changes in sludge composition and to adapt accordingly the operating conditions. The usefulness of the device for this purpose was evaluated for five months after monitoring four MBR plants in Berlin with different activated sludge characteristics (MLSS from 5 to 21 g/L, SRT 12–35d and COD in the supernatant 30–400 mg/L). The first results show a good agreement between the filterability of the sludge with the portable filtration test cell and the filtration performance of the plant. Critical flux values varied between 3 and 30L/m2 h during the studied period. Useful information concerning the irreversibility of the fouling was provided by looking at the hysteresis curve of the flux-stepping experiments.},

This paper is the first known attempt to quantify the volume ofMAR at global scale, and to illustrate the advancement of all the major types ofMAR and relate these to research and regulatory advancements. Faced with changing climate and rising intensity ofclimate extremes, MAR is an increasingly important water management strategy, alongside demand management, to maintain, enhance and secure stressed groundwater systems and to protect and improve water quality. During this time, scientific research—on hydraulic design offacilities, tracer studies, managing clogging, recovery efficiency and water quality changes in aquifers—has underpinned practical improvements in MAR and has had broader benefits in hydrogeology. Recharge wells have greatly accelerated recharge, particularly in urban areas and for mine water management. In recent years, research into governance, operating practices, reliability, economics, risk assessment and public acceptance ofMAR has been undertaken. Since the 1960s, implementation of MAR has accelerated at a rate of 5%/year, but is not keeping pace with increasing groundwater extraction. Currently, MAR has reached an estimated 10 km3/year, ~2.4% of groundwater extraction in countries reporting MAR (or ~1.0% of global groundwater extraction). MAR is likely to exceed 10% of global extraction, based on experience where MAR is more advanced, to sustain quantity, reliability and quality ofwater supplies.},

In order to model the performance of river bank and slow sand filtration plants, we are studying the different mechanisms by which the elimination of pathogens is realized. An important question concerning the mode of action of slow sand filters and river bank filtration units is the role of the colmation layer or “schmutzdecke” on the elimination of human pathogens. The  schmutzdecke is an organic layer which develops at the surface of the sand filter short after the onset of operation. We have inoculated a pilot plant for slow sand filtration with coliphages and determined their rate of breakthrough and their final elimination. In the first experiment, with a colmation layer still missing, the breakthrough of the coliphages in the 80 cm mighty sandy bed amounted to ca. 40 %. In contrast, less than 1 % of coliphages escaped from the filter as the same experiment was repeated two months later, when a substantial colmation layer had developed. Our preliminary conclusions are that the colmation layer is extremely efficient in eliminating of viruses.},

   abstract = {The widespread application of the membrane-assisted activated sludge process is restricted by membrane fouling, which increases investment and operating costs. Soluble microbial products (SMPs) are currently considered as the major cause of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study aims at elucidating and quantifying the effects of varying environmental conditions on SMP elimination and rejection based on findings in a pilot MBR and in well-defined lab trials. Several factors are thought to influence the concentration ofSMP and their fouling propensity in one way or the other, but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Here, SMP loading rate was found to have the greatest effect on SMP elimination and thus on concentration in the MBR. The degree of elimination decreased at very lowDO and low nitrate concentrations. On average, 75% of influent SMP were eliminated in both pilot and lab trials, with the elimination of polysaccharides (PS) mostly above 80%. Rejection of SMP components by the used membrane (PAN, 37nm) ranged mainly from 20% to 70% for proteins and from 75% to 100% for PS. Especially protein rejection decreased at higher temperatures and higher nitrification activity. The increased fouling rates at lower temperatures might therefore partly be explained by this increased rejection. Apparently, mainly the nitrite-oxidising community is responsible for the formation for smaller SMP molecules that can pass the membrane.},

   abstract = {Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are considered as the major cause of membrane fouling in membranebioreactors. Recent studies have revealed a linear relationship between fouling rate (increase of filtration resistanceover time) and polysaccharide (PS) concentration [1]. Several factors like the type of wastewater, sludge loading rate, sludge age, MLSS concentration, and mechanical stress are known to influence the concentration of dissolved EPS. Also, unsteady states like intermittent feeding or shifts in the oxygen supply have been identified as additionalfactors leading to an increase in EPS formation or to a change in its fouling propensity. However, no systematicinvestigation to quantify such influences has been undertaken so far. This study is aimed at determining the influenceof discontinuous excess sludge withdrawal often applied in small decentralised plants and resulting unsteady loadingrates on EPS formation and filtration resistance. The general trend of increased fouling rate at higher PS concentrationsis confirmed but data show a larger scatter which could be due to a change in the PS structure and hence their fouling potential. The levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrate which also fluctuate more strongly in MBRs withirregular sludge wastage appear to have a profound impact on EPS uptake rate and thereby on EPS concentration.},

At the study‘s test site, Westewitz wastewater treatment facility, a micro filter was loaded with varying polymer and coagulant doses. The resulting primary sludge was examined both qualitatively and quantitatively. The study also evaluated the effect of carbon diversion on the subsequent sequencing batch reactors.
The study results show that carbon reduction efficiency is closely tied to chemical use. This produces different amounts of sludge with varying quality levels. Carbon separation was shown to unfavorably affect the efficiency of sludge activation. Futhermore, an assessment was done of the potential energy yield of the diverted sludge in relation to the filter’s energy need. This assessment indicated that the filter’s theoretical gas yield can cover its operational energy consumption.},

Bis 2015 konnte dieses Ziel jedoch nicht erreicht werden. Der Überschuss an Nährstoffen in Oberflächengewässern ist ein Aspekt, der zum Misserfolg des Vorhabens beitrug. Eine Rolle spielen hierbei die Nährstofffrachten, die aus urbanen Gebieten über die Kanalisation in die Gewässer gelangen. In dieser Arbeit werden daher Maßnahmen untersucht, die zur Reduktion der Nährstoffemissionen aus dem Kanalnetz dienen. Es wird eine Ökobilanz zu ausgewählten Maßnahmen der zentralen Regenwasserbewirtschaftung durchgeführt. Die Maßnahmen werden hinsichtlich ihres ökologischen Aufwandes (Materialbedarf, Transport, Energiebedarf, etc.) und ihres ökologischen Nutzens (Nährstoffreduktion) analysiert. Dabei wird zwischen Maßnahmen im Trenn- und Mischsystem unterschieden. Im Trennsystem wer-den ein Retentionsbodenfilter (RBF), drei unterschiedliche Regenklärbecken (RKB), ein Lamellenab-scheider (LA) und eine Nachrüstung eines RKB mittels Lamellen untersucht. Im Mischsystem erfolgt eine Analyse von einem Regenüberlaufbecken (RÜB), einem Stauraumkanal (SK) und drei Stauraum-aktivierungsmaßnahmen. Zu diesen gehören eine Abflusssteuerung durch eine eingebaute Drossel-anlage und zwei Umbaumaßnahmen zur Nutzung des Speichervolumens von Überlaufkanälen. Der Vollständigkeit halber wurden ein vereinfachtes Modell einer Großkläranlage, einer Schlammbehand-lung sowie einer Klärschlammverbrennungsanlage (KSVA) in die Betrachtung miteinbezogen. Um eine Aussage über potentielle Umweltauswirkungen treffen zu können, werden für die Wirkungsab-schätzung unter anderem das Treibhauspotential (GWP), die marine (MEP) und Süßwasser Eutro-phierung (FEP) sowie zwei Toxizitätspotentiale betrachtet. Zudem erfolgt eine Analyse zum kumulier-ten Energieaufwand (KEA) fossiler und nuklearer Energieträger. In den Ergebnissen stellt sich die Infrastruktur als maßgeblicher Faktor für den ökologischen Aufwand heraus. Zudem spielt insbesondere im Mischsystem die zusätzlichen Aufwendungen auf der Kläranla-ge eine große Rolle. Der Aufwand für den Betrieb und die Wartung der Maßnahmen hingegen ist vergleichsweise gering. Im Trennsystem besitzen der Retentionsbodenfilter und der Lamellenab-scheider die geringsten negativen Umweltauswirkungen. Der Bau von Regenklärbecken geht diesbe-züglich mit weitaus höheren Auswirkungen einher.

   type = {Master Thesis},
   year = {2015},
   abstract = {Urban stormwater runoff is a potential entrance pathway for a wide range of anthropogenic trace pollutants, like biocides, plasticizers, heavy metals or flame retardants, to urban lakes and rivers. However, little is known on dependencies of the occurrence of these trace pollutants on rain event characteristics and climate or seasonal influences. Furthermore, the importance of such dependencies for the calculation of loads and the uncertainties involved are unclear. This thesis evaluates possible correlations between trace pollutant concentrations in urban stormwater runoff and rain event characteristics together with further climate and seasonal influences, based on a large set of measurements from the project “Trace organics in Berlin stormwater runoff (OgRe)”. Here, samples were taken in a one-year monitoring program for five stormwater catchments representing specific urban structure types. Additionally, this thesis investigates whether the consideration of those correlations is necessary for the calculation of loads or whether the use of a mean concentration is sufficient. A method for the correlation analysis is developed and applied to the data, under the requirement to use just one influencing factor (predictor) per correlation and to keep the models simple. Regression models are fitted with regard to normal and log-normal error distributions. The models are evaluated regarding their goodness of fit using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, the log-likelihood ratio, and the prediction coefficient of determination. For 45 out of 48 of the considered substances at least one correlation (i.e. in one of the five catchments) with rain or climate predictors is found. In addition, it is demonstrated that seasonal influences have an effect on substance concentrations for 25 out of 48 substances. Thus, the selected predictor values prove useful to explain the measured concentrations. Only 11 substances show the same correlation with a rain/climate predictor in four catchments and none in all five catchments. So, while concentrations for single events in one catchment can be well explained by the correlations, overall concentration patterns seem to be strongly influenced by the catchment, i.e. its urban structure type. Furthermore, it is shown that the assumption of a normally distributed error does not represent the data adequately in most cases. Consideration of a log-normal error distribution improves most regression models significantly. Regarding single substances, the correlation analysis helps to explain observed patterns. For instance, terbuthylazine, an agricultural pesticide, was only detected during typical application months of May and June, with the same observation in all five catchments. Accordingly, atmospheric deposition from the agricultural surroundings seems a reasonable explanation. In a second example, nicotine was found at very high concentrations in four catchments for low rain event durations, showing a strong decrease with increasing duration. This behavior can be explained by the fast elution of nicotine from cigarette butts within the first minutes of a rain event, followed by dilution during longer rain events. An exemplary load estimation based on a 30-year rain series for Berlin using a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that the use of regression models versus mean concentrations can lead to very different results. The reason lies in the selection of sampled rain events which are not distributed according their contribution to the total runoff volume (there should be more small to medium rain events, which contribute more to the total runoff volume). In conclusion, errors in the load estimation can result from i) using a mean concentration instead of a valid correlation, but also from ii) using a non-valid correlation. This underlines the importance of performing a correlation analysis before load calculations, but also the importance of a critical evaluation of the sample data and the correlations. For the latter, a combined evaluation along several goodness-of-fit metrics is suggested, together with plausibility checks of the correlation and of the considered range of values within which the regression model is applied.},

Das Baden in Flüssen war bis zum Beginn des letzten Jahrhunderts in Berlin eine Selbstverständlichkeit. Zahlreiche öffentliche Flussbäder befanden sich im Bereich der innerstädtischen Spree. Erst durch die mit der beginnenden Industrialisierung und der wachsenden Bevölkerung zunehmende Verschlechterung der Wasserquali-tät mussten die städtischen Bäder geschlossen werden und wurden durch die auch heute noch weitgehend genutzten Strandbäder im Stadtrandgebiet ersetzt. Die derzeitige stoffliche Belastung der Spree im Projektgebiet erfolgt durch die Ein-träge aus den Brandenburger Zuflüssen, dem Klarwasserablauf des Klärwerkes Mün-chehofe, den Einleitungen aus dem Berliner Trennsystem sowie den Mischwasser-entlastungen des Berliner Mischsystems. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass die Überläufe aus dem Mischsystem der Berliner Ka-nalisation eine wesentliche Verschmutzungsquelle der Spree darstellen. Vorrangiges Ziel des Projektes berlinbeach ist es daher, die Mischwasserentlastungen durch in der Spree angeordnete Speicher (Fangbecken) weitgehend zu vermeiden und da-durch die Badegewässerqualität in der innerstädtischen Spree nach Möglichkeit zu gewährleisten. Darüber hinaus ist vorgesehen, die Speicher mit entsprechenden Aufbauten zu versehen und diese zur Refinanzierung der Maßnahme zu nutzen.},

On one hand, the population growth and urban development and on the other hand, climate change and decreasing precipitation will increase the vital role of underground water resources to supply water for the cities, therefore an increase in the energy consumption in well fields has to be expected. It is becoming more difficult to ignore the cost of pumping energy for water stakeholders in Germany and Europe. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in optimisation of energy consumption in different fields. The goal of this study is first to design a relational database to store the information of submersible pumps and second to develop a database management system for this pump database. The pump database is intended to be used in prototype model software aiming at the minimisation of a well field's pump energy demand. To this end, two approaches of assessing the necessary data for submersible pumps, and building a relational database are going to be discussed in this study. Finally, two applications with graphical user interfaces which have been developed by using the programming language “R” are presented for loading the data into the database, visualizing the database tables and plotting the pump curves.},

For sulfamethoxazole (sulfonamide), a significant but not complete removal during bank filtration was observed. It was the only compound that could be detected at tracelevels in samples collected from water-supply wells.},

   abstract = {The frequent occurrence of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) in the (sub)-tropics has been largely associated with cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales of tropical origin, in particular Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. C. raciborskii is currently observed to spread northwards into temperate climatic zones. In addition, further cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales typically inhabiting water bodies in temperate regions are being identified as CYN-producers. Therefore, data on the distribution of CYN in temperate regions are necessary for a first assessment of potential risks due to CYN in water used for drinking and recreation. A total of 127 lakes situated in the northeastern part of Germany were investigated in 2004 for the presence of the toxin CYN and the phytoplankton composition. The toxin could be detected in half of the lakes (n ¼ 63) and in half of 165 samples (n ¼ 88). Concentrations reached up to 73.2 _g CYN/g DW. CYN thus proved more widely distributed than previously demonstrated. The analyses of phytoplankton data suggest Aphanizomenon sp. and Anabaena sp. as important CYN producers in Germany, and confirm recent findings of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae as CYN-producing species frequently inhabiting water bodies in temperate climatic regions. The data shown here suggest that CYN may be an important cyanobacterial toxin in German water bodies and that further data are needed to assess this.},

   abstract = {Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have been increasingly employed for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment in the last decade. The efforts for modelling of such wastewater treatment systems have always targeted either the biological processes (treatment quality target) as well as the various aspects of engineering (cost effective design and operation). The development of Activated Sludge Models (ASM) was an important evolution in the modelling of Conventional Activated Sludge (CAS) processes and their use is now very well established. However, although they were initially developed to describe CAS processes, they have simply been transferred and applied to MBR processes. Recent studies on MBR biological processes have reported several crucial specificities: medium to very high sludge retention times, high mixed liquor concentration, accumulation of soluble microbial products (SMP) rejected by the membrane filtration step, and high aeration rates for scouring purposes. These aspects raise the question as to what extent the ASM framework is applicable to MBR processes. Several studies highlighting some of the aforementioned issues are scattered through the literature. Hence, through a concise and structured overview of the past developments and current state-of-the-art in biological modelling of MBR, this review explores ASMebased modelling applied to MBR processes. The work aims to synthesize previous studies and differentiates between unmodified and modified applications of ASM to MBR. Particular emphasis is placed on influent fractionation, biokinetics, and soluble microbial products (SMPs)/exo-polymeric substances (EPS) modelling,},

   abstract = {The present work deals with the possibility of using capillary nanofiltration (NF) in combination with bank filtration as a pretreatment step for drinking water production. Main goal is to show the removal of selected compounds including sulphate and organic micropollutants (OMP) during the NF. Also demonstrating the benefits of bank filtration as a pretreatment step in comparison to the direct treatment of surface water using capillary NF. For that purpose, a demonstration site in pilot scale was operated as a part of the European project AquaNES at the waterworks Tiefwerder in Berlin. Since 2017 several studies (Hoff, 2017; Rohde, 2018; Jährig et al., 2018) were conducted with drinking water and anoxic well water as feed sources for the NF pilot plant. Building on these the main objective of the present thesis is to optimize the NF pilot plant operation using suboxic well water and surface water as a feed source. Operating data was analyzed and sampling campaigns were carried out to determine the retention capacity of the capillary NF membranes for selected compounds. High retention was achieved for sulphate (45 - 67 %), hardness (55 %), iron (80 %) and selected OMPs further with removal of DOC (56 – 88 %). Microbiological sampling showed a higher impact of microbial growth during the operation of the pilot plant with surface water compared to well water. Furthermore different cleaning agents were tested concerning their ability to restore the membrane performance and their costs. Regarding the specific energy consumption, different measures showed a reduction of plant energy need can be achieved. In conclusion the experiments show a higher impact of biofouling during the direct surface water treatment in comparison to the pretreatment with bank filtration. Long term operation of the tested capillary NF is possible. Under the influence of oxygen and microbial growth there is a high demand of chemical cleaning.},

   abstract = {This document represents the progress report of the 2015 activities in El Port de la Selva within the frame of the DEMOWORK project. Following the ACA-permission obtained in October 2014, a yearly progress report has to be provided. According to this year’s activities, the progress report summarizes pond construction, the upgrades implemented at the waste water treatment plant (WWTP), the progress of groundwater flow modelling, all sampling and monitoring activities as well as the started DEMOWARE tasks on risk assessment and life cycle analysis. Pond construction followed a tender procedure and comprised connecting the hill deposit with the ponds via a pipeline as well as excavating, paving and filling three basins for infiltration of reclaimed water. These activities started in August 2015 and were finished with a progress meeting on site on 26th October 2015. In parallel, nitrate and phosphate removal at the WWTP were optimized to reduce the variation of effluent quality and disinfection was switched to UV disinfection only. Electric conductivity was chosen as threshold parameter for infiltration. Thus, online probes were installed and incorporated into the SCADA system. With regard to trace organic substances, the WWTP upgrade will be continued with the addition of granular activated carbon (GAC) to the filters in 2016. The methods of life cycle assessment will be additionally used to evaluate the environmental impacts of water reuse for the planned updates compared to staus quo of treatment. Infiltration of reclaimed tertiary effluent was set into operation on 17th November. Before, a third sampling campaign was conducted to assess the effluent and groundwater chemistry before infiltration and a monitoring schedule for the infiltration phase itself was agreed on. Monitoring will be carried out by VWSI and EMACBSA with support of Amphos21 and KWB. The monitoring schedule involves the effluent quality (secondary and tertiary), ambient groundwater, infiltrated water from the pond as well as a transect of pre-existing and newly drilled observation wells. In addition to three piezometers drilled in October 2014 (documented within this report), two additional piezometers were drilled near the ponds in order to monitor infiltration dynamics, hydraulics and the subsurface removal capacity regarding trace organic substances and microorganisms (bacteria, phages and viruses). The results of the pre-infiltration sampling campaigns were used for an entry-level risk assessment with regard to micobiological and chemical risks. So far, rotavirus removal was taken for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Chemical risk assessment focused on four selected pharmaceuticals and acesulfam as these substances were above the limits of quantification (LoQ) in the effluent samples. Travel times and other aquifer parameters were taken from the groundwater flow model obtained by Amphos 21 showing a good capability to reproduce measured head responses in the observation and two nearby drinking water abstraction wells, for which data were obtained from the owners and used for model calibration. The DEMOWARE progress and status of activities, as summarized within this report, were further disseminated at different occasions, including the information of the health authority and the local drinking water supplier SOREA at the on-site meeting in October, a special DEMOWARE session at this year’s ReWater conference in Braunschweig as well as an information event for the El Port de la Selva inhabitants organised by the mayor of El Port de la Selva and CCB.},

   abstract = {The present report characterizes the field sites Lake Tegel and Lake Wannsee as well as the artificial recharge site GWA Tegel in terms of their clogging layer, sedimentary, hydraulic and hydrochemical properties. As a result, a solid basis for the interpretation of specific compounds evaluated within NASRI and for subsequent modeling and quantification of the data is given. Major problems or difficulties where identified, in order to focus investigations on aspects not fully understood to date in the next project phase. The combination of different tracers enables the interpretation of the flow regime. With the help of T/He analysis, ages of different water bodies can be estimated. The analysis of tracer showing distinct seasonal variations is used to estimate travel times while water constituents which are either mainly present in the bank filtrate or the background water are used for mixing calculations. The proportions of treated wastewater in the surface water were estimated in front of the transects. The surface water composition varies largely both in time and space, which is a problem at Wannsee, where the surface water sampling point is not representative for the bank filtration input. Estimates for travel times of the bank filtrate to individual observation and production wells are given and vary between days and several months. The production wells are a mixture of bank filtrate and water from inland of the wells and deeper aquifers, proportions of bank filtrate are given where possible to differentiate between contaminant removal and dilution. They vary between < 20 and > 80 %. The new observation wells enable a vertical differentiation of the infiltrate. It becomes clear that at Tegel and Wannsee, there is a strong vertical succession towards larger proportions of considerably older bank filtrate with depth. At the Wannsee transect, the observation wells deeper than the lake do not reflect the surface water signal at all. It will be important to combine the new information with hydraulic information of existing flow models (mainly of the IGB “model” group). The evaluation of the redox conditions shows that redox successions proceed with depth rather than (only) in flow direction. In addition, the redox zoning (as characterised by the appearance or disappearance of redox sensitive species) is very transient. The zones are much wider in winter than in summer, in particular at the artificial recharge site GWA Tegel, probably due to temperature effects. This poses a challenge for the desired modelling and the interpretation of data from redoxsensitive substances.},

   year = {2014},
   abstract = {Sludge treatment and disposal is one of the key positions of operating costs in large wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). On large WWTPs, dewatering of digested sludge is mainly performed with centrifuges. The performance of the centrifuge and thus, the (cost-)efficiency of the whole sludge dewatering process, strongly depends on the operating parameters of the centrifuge and the properties/preparation and dosage of the polymer used as flocculation aid. The research project “Decamax” therefore mainly focuses on these aspects and their impact on the dewatering result, i.e. mainly the dry solid content of the sludge cake and the quality of the sludge liquor. Moreover, the impact of sludge pre-heating on sludge dewatering is assessed, because it is known that the dewatering temperature has a high influence on the process as well. Besides a technical study (Work Package 3) and full-scale trials at a WWTP in Berlin (WP 1), the project included trials with a 0.4 m³/h pilot-scale centrifugation unit in Braunschweig (Work Package 2). The results of this work package (performed by the Institute of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering, Technische Universität Braunschweig (ISWW)) are summarised in this report. Besides the ISWW, the pilot-scale trials were supported and evaluated by the Stadtentwässerung Braunschweig (SE|BS), the KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) – also responsible for the overall project management and control – and Kläranlagenberatung Kopp (KBK). Moreover, the Decamax project team and technical committee include the Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) and Veolia Wasser. The project is financially supported by Veolia Water and BWB.},

   abstract = {Low-pressure membrane filtration of secondary effluents allows disinfection and, combined with chemical coagulation, advanced phosphorus removal. However, the loss of filtration performance due to membrane fouling is still a fundamental problem and has a strong impact on the costs of the process. Biopolymers as well as colloids in the range of 50 to 350 nm were identified as main foulants during ultrafiltration (UF). In this project the impact of a pre-treatment by ozonation (2-10 mg O3/L) and subsequent coagulation (FeCl3: 2-6 mg Fe3+/L) on the performance of a polymer UF membrane was studied. No free dissolved ozone was in contact with the membrane. Lab tests were performed using Amicon test cells in dead-end mode fed with 500 mL secondary effluent of the WWTP Ruhleben (Berlin) and the flux decline during filtration was measured. The effect of the two pre-treatment steps on the character of DOC, especially the biopolymer fraction, was investigated using size exclusion chromatography. The pre-treatment enables phosphorus removal of 75 up to 95 % with permeate concentrations of 30 to 50 μg P/L. In filtration tests pre-ozonation without flocculation leads to a less distinct flux decline (1-7 %). Coagulation without pre-ozonation increases the flux by 5 to 14 % compared to filtration of effluent without pre-tretament. The combination of both pretreatment steps improves the filtration performance up to 30 % and reduces the filtration time for 500 mL by 50 %. Different mechanisms are considered as reasons for the improved performance. It is known that coagulation partially removes the fouling-active biopolymers and humic substances. The pre-treatment with ozone, even at low dosages (2 mg/L), leads to a significant decrease of UV254 absorbance, pointing on a shift to more polar molecules. Higher ozone dosages (> 6 mg/L) additionally induce disintegration of biopolymers and a shift to smaller organic compounds. The interaction between ozonation and coagulation leads to a partial complexation of iron in solution. As a consequence, less iron is provided for the coagulation process. As the percentage of complexation of iron decreases with increasing coagulant dosage, the synergetic effect of pre-ozonation and coagulation on the filtration performance increases with increasing iron dosage. These results suggest that combining pre-ozonation and coagulation can be a promising pretreatment process to reduce the fouling of organic membranes, without the necessity of applying free dissolved ozone on the membrane surface.},

   abstract = {The paper presents semi-analytical mathematical model to estimate unsteady groundwater recharge resulting from variable depth of water in a large water body, influenced by time variant inflows and outflows. The model has been derived by integrating Hantush’s (1967) analytical expression for water table rise due to recharge from a rectangular spreading basin into the water balance equation of the water body. The model has been applied to a test study site in Raipur (India) for assessing viability of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) from a lake located on an area dominated by the massive limestone formation. The components of the water balance equation have been carried out by the comprehensive analysis of the hydrological and hydrogeological aspects of the lake. The hydrological components include
analysis of rainfall-runoff, evaporation rate, lake water quality and the hydrogeological components include aquifer characterization, parameters estimate, ambient groundwater level
and quality. The time variant depth of water resulting from the interaction of water balance components, computed using the model, has been compared with the measured data and found
a satisfactory match, as revealed from RMSE analysis. Compared to the inflows and lake storages, the recharge rates from the lake found very less, which ranged between 3.75 and 4.82 mm/day for depth of water ranged between 2.5 and 3.36 m. The lake water quality indicated contamination by bacteriological parameters (viz. Fecal coliform and Total coliform), turbidity and COD, exceeding the permissible limit of drinking water standards (IS-
10500:2012). The aquifer formations below the lakebed and around possess thick limestone formation - a limiting factor for MAR-ASTR proposition, and hence no engineered hydrogeological intervention has been found viable to enhance the recharge rate.},

Potential water source for this MAR site is the effluent of the local WWTP, which is a quite constant water source in terms of availability, but gives concerns in terms of water quality. The investigations carried out within DEMEAU supports the work previously done by the Water Recovery Project (2011 – 2014), coordinated by IGME (Instituto Geológico y Minero de España) and UJI (Universitat Jaume I). The Water Recovery Project consists of different implementation phases and aimed to establish an appropriate MAR scheme with reclaimed wastewater to counteract salinity ingress in the coastal aquifer. In the third phase of the project two injection wells have recharged 310,000 m3 with water from the Belcaire River. To foster the implementation of the fourth and final phase of the Water Recovery Project, DEMEAU focused on the evaluation of the effluent of the local WWTP as source water for the ASTR system. This has been done by three sampling campaigns to analyse bulk chemistry, emerging pollutants and bioassays in native groundwater (six agricultural wells), Belcaire River (the current source water of the MAR scheme) and WWTP effluent (potential future source water). Risk assessment based on Australian MAR guidelines have been applied to evaluate risks related to the usage of WWTP effluent as source water. The Australian guidelines have been applied in two steps: entry level assessment and maximal risk assessment. Entry level assessment concluded that La Vall d’Uixó is suitable for a MAR scheme using reclaimed water, while maximal risk assessment identified hazards associated to reclaimed water as source water. As La Vall d’Uixó is an agricultural area of citrus crops, the use of reclaimed water for the injection in the MAR system must be compatible with the use of recovered water for irrigation. The risk assessment done in this report considered this end use of water, as there are no drinking water wells in the area. High risks have been identified for inorganic chemicals (conductivity, chloride and bicarbonate) and nutrients (nitrate). Risks associated to inorganics can be minimized by mixing effluent and Belcaire River water 1:1. Bulk chemistry coincided mainly with the description carried out in Water Recovery project, identifying two main quality problems in native groundwater: (1) salinity ingress (2) high nitrate concentration due to the intensive agricultural practices in the area. Ion displacement pattern in groundwater samples clearly indicates on-going salinization and documents minor effects of the injected water on few wells only. Cl/Br ratios indicate additional sources of chloride apart from seawater. It seems plausible that the underlying Keuper formations (Triassic) contribute to salinity ingress and SO4 excess in groundwater to some extent. Chlorides and nitrate are regulated by the implementation in Spain of the EU Water Framework Directive for the Castellón aquifer. The threshold value for nitrate is 200 mg/L, while the threshold value for chloride is 650 mg/L. WWTP effluent has nitrate and chlorides below the threshold concentrations (60 mg/L and 140 mg/L respectively) and, therefore, the MAR with reclaimed water would suppose a reduction of groundwater pollution and a step towards a qualitative good status in the aquifer. In total 63 organic micro pollutants have been analysed in groundwater, surface water and WWTP effluent. WWTP effluent shows elevated concentrations in almost all groups of organic micro pollutants compared to river- or groundwater. Only pesticides are found in higher concentrations in groundwater compared to the effluent. The Belcaire River shows the lowest concentrations for all groups of micro pollutants. It was shown that the Vall d’Uixó aquifer is contaminated by various organic micro pollutants and does not reflect a near natural aquifer condition. The aquifer chemistry in terms of organic micro pollutants reflects the usage of (untreated) effluent for direct irrigation over years. Elevated concentration of artificial sweeteners, analgesics, stimulants, caffeine metabolites and cocaine metabolites were found in WWTP samples taken during weekends compared to workday samples. In contrast, iopromide has been quantified in higher concentrations in the effluent of WWTP in work days than in the weekend, as this contrast media is used in hospitals for diagnostic tests normally carried out from Monday to Friday. These patterns of the effluent of WWTP during the week of weekend could be determinant for the selection of the working days as most suitable days to store treated waste water. In order to link analysed chemical concentrations to the observed toxicity in the samples a procedure based on bioassay-specific relative potency (REP) factors was applied. REP factors are determined by the effect concentrations of the reference compound and of the test compound. Despite the lack of toxicological data for a number of the selected target compounds and the lower relevance of the selected compounds for (eco)toxicological risk assessment, this study greatly demonstrate the usefulness of combined analyses of environmental samples. Effect-based methods could complement conventional chemical analysis in water quality monitoring as pre-screening techniques by (1) identifying toxic “hotspots” for further investigation, (2) assessing the effect of the entire mixture of compounds present in waters and therefore and (3) reduce uncertainty in safety evaluation.},

   abstract = {The objective of this research project is to identify and test various phosphorus removal processes or process combinations, including membrane biorector (MBR) technologies. This should enable to establish efficient and cost effective P-removal strategies for upgrading small sewage treatment units (up to 10,000 PE), as needed in some decentralised areas of Berlin. In particular, enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) technology was developed and optimised in MBR. In addition, Padsorption on activated media was tested with the MBR permeate in order to achieve low P-values down to 50µg/L in the effluent. One MBR bench-scale plant of 200 to 250L (BSP) and two MBR pilot plants of 1 to 3m3 each (PP1 and PP2) were operated in parallel to a conventional wastewater treatment plant (Ruhleben WWTP, Berlin, Germany). The membrane bioreactors were tested with EBPR configurations in predenitrification, and post-denitrification mode without additional carbon source. The MBR pilot and bench-scale plants were operated under sludge ages of respectively 26 and 15 days. Eight extended measurement programs (Profile measurements, P-mass balance) were carried out during the continuous operation of 6 months (September 2001 - April 2002). The effluent concentration of total phosphorus was very low and stable between 0.05 and 0.16 mg/L in both configurations. A comparison to the Ruhleben WWTP showed, that the effluent concentrations for COD, TN and TP were slightly lower for the MBR due to the particulate fraction of the WWTP. Measurements along the multi-stage reactors showed that P-uptake occurred in the anoxic and the aerobic zones. The P-mass-balance of the systems was found to be incomplete. The P-content of the biomass was about 2,0 – 2,4% of TS. The related P-mass rejected with the excess sludge was inferior to the P-mass entering the system in the influent. The reasons could not be validated. However, the effluent PT-concentration was observed to be stable and low during this period. Investigations with lab columns indicated that P-adsorption could lead to TP concentrations down to 50 µg/L from both 0.1 and 0.3mg/L and no particle accumulation occurred in the filter media. The three tested materials exhibited great differences in break-through curves. Granulated Ferric Hydroxyde (GEH®) showed higher capacity than activated alumina and Ferro Sorp Plus.},

   abstract = {In work package 4 the influence of different treatments (ozonation, coagulation) on macromolecular organic substances (biopolymers) in secondary effluent and the effects on subsequent ultrafiltration were investigated at lab-scale. Furthermore, fouling mechanisms were intensively investigated and an analytical method was developed to observe the formation of ozonation by-products. Analyses with LC-OCD showed a significant reduction of major organic foulants (biopolymers) for coagulation while ozonation appears to transform macromolecules into compounds smaller than approx. 50 nm. With ultrafiltration tests (PES membranes) it could be shown that coagulation is capable to reduce total fouling resistance to some extent and additional ozonation can further enhance the membrane filtration process. However ozonation as a pretreatment step caused more irreversible fouling. The lowest irreversible fouling was achieved with coagulation. LC-OCD analyses showed that the transformation of organic matter by ozonation is mainly responsible for the observed increased irreversible fouling of ultrafiltration membranes. Tests with different membranes showed comparable results for pretreated secondary effluent concerning total fouling resistance. Total fouling resistance was reduced with additional ozonation compared to coagulation without ozonation. In contrast to the observations with all tested UF membranes, for the tested microfiltration membranes irreversible fouling was reduced with additional ozonation. In general, the pore size seems to be strongly influencing irreversible fouling if ozonation is used for pretreatment of membrane filtration. Intensive investigations of fouling mechanisms using filtration laws identified cake filtration as the dominant filtration process for coagulation while additional ozonation leads to increased pore blocking/in pore fouling. Experiments with secondary effluents from different sewage treatment plants in Berlin showed comparable fouling behavior for all observed pretreatments. Thus membrane filtration results generated with samples from WWTP Ruhleben seem to be transferable to other WWTPs in Berlin. MALDI-TOF-MS analyses of secondary effluent were not suitable to identify major organic foulants, neither in solution nor on top of the membrane after filtration. Consequently, MALDI-TOF-MS was primarily used for investigations of theoretical aspects of fouling by using model fouling substances. An analytical procedure for bromate was successfully developed with LC-MS/MS at TUB. With the procedure it was possible to quantify samples up to a limit of quantification of 0.5 µg bromate per liter. Higher concentrations of bromate (> 10 µg/L) were produced only at specific ozone consumptions higher than 0.9 mgO3/mgDOC0.},

   abstract = {Der Einsatz von Niederdruckmembranen (Mikro- und Ultrafiltration) zur Aufbereitung von biologisch behandeltem Abwasser ermöglicht eine weitergehende Entfernung von Mikroorganismen und damit eine verbesserte hygienische Ablaufqualität. Membranfouling, also die Ablagerung von Wasserinhaltsstoffen auf oder in der Membran und eine damit verbundene Verringerung der Membranpermeabilität gelten dabei als ein wesentliches Problem. Gerade das irreversible Fouling verhindert einen vermehrten Einsatz dieser Aufbereitungstechnik. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass organische Makromoleküle in erheblichem Maße für das Fouling verantwortlich sind. Mittels Fluoreszenzanalytik und Größenausschlusschromatographie konnten Proteine hierbei als stark foulingverursachende Fraktion identifiziert werden. Filtrationsversuche mit Standard-Proteinlösungen über Niederdruckmembranen bestätigen deren Foulingpotenzial. Dies wird auf elektrostatische und hydrophobe Wechselwirkungen zwischen Membran und Protein (Porenverblockung /einschnürung) zurückgeführt bzw. mit intermolekularen Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Proteinen erklärt (Deckschichtbildung). Weiterhin hat der pH-Wert einer Proteinlösung starken Einfluss auf die Filtrierbarkeit. Bisherige Untersuchungen zeigen hier jedoch unterschiedliche Ergebnisse. Während Koehler et al. (1997) in Fouling-Maximum im Bereich des isoelektrischen Punktes (IEP) feststellen, zeigt Salgin (2007) ein stärkeres Fouling bei pH<IEP. Die genaue Ursache ist unklar und wird von verschiedenen Autoren in unterschiedlichem Maße den oben genannten Wechselwirkungen zugeschrieben. Der überwiegende Teil der Untersuchungen ist für die Membranfiltration in der Abwasseraufbereitung nur in beschränktem Maße relevant, da die eingesetzten Proteinkonzentrationen mit >100mg/L deutlich über dem Bereich des Klarlaufs einer kommunalen Kläranlage liegen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde der Einfluss unterschiedlicher Faktoren (pH-Wert, Hintergrundmatrix) auf die Filtrationseigenschaften und das Proteinfouling im geringeren Konzentrationsbereich (5 mg/L) untersucht.

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {This report attempts to give a survey from literature on the microorganisms involved, on the factors and mechanisms potentially relevant for the susceptibility of drinking water wells to health related microbial contamination. The habitat groundwater accommodates a rich diversity of microorganisms, which has only begun to be identified since the development of molecular detection methods in addition to the conservative cultivation techniques. Characteristics of the subsurface are darkness, low spaces, low nutrient and low oxygen content. Indigenous microorganisms have adapted to these oligotrophic conditions and are able to proliferate in this environment permanently. Other incoming microorganisms generally cannot reproduce under these conditions, but have developed strategies to survive. They can grow only, when the parameters turn favourable. Pathogenic microorganisms comprise bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, which can also survive a certain time in groundwater. Most microorganisms in the subsurface are attached to surfaces and survive best within biofilm populations. Pathogenic microorganisms originate from human or animal faeces. These organisms are not easily detected. The methods are very time and labour consuming. Therefore, other microorganisms regularly present in the faeces are used for detection. Their presence indicates the possibility of a contamination with pathogens. As indicator microorganisms mostly coliform bacteria, E. coli, enterococci and clostridia are used. Contamination with pathogens is reported to derive essentially from communal sources: defects in wastewater treatment plants, sewage tanks, pipes, and waste deposits; from agricultural sources: animal wastes, liquid manure, and grazing; and from point sources like faeces from animals, birds, and humans. Entrance into the subsurface occurs via rainwater and surface waters, as well as by direct contamination of wells. The transport of the microorganisms into the subsurface is influenced by the geologic conditions of a specific site: soil and rock type, presence of fissures, heterogeneity. In sand, microbial movement is less far than e.g. in Karst regions, thus the susceptibility to contamination of groundwater and wells is lower. Pore sizes are crucial for sedimentation and filter efficiency of the soil. Also important is the extent of the unsaturated zone, the flow velocity of the groundwater, the geochemistry and mineralogy of the site. Wells receive their water from the groundwater reservoir of the surrounding soil. The quality of the well water is therefore essentially dependent on the properties of the groundwater and all the factors influencing the groundwater may also be relevant for the well water. The wells represent, in addition, a separate complex system with specific conditions and influencing parameters. This specific habitat involves additional variable adsorption surfaces, more space, higher flow velocity of the water, a mixing of waters from different groundwater layers and thus a different chemical composition. Contamination may also arise from microbial introduction at the open wellhead. Two main processes have been identified which are essentially responsible for the elimination of pathogens during their pathway from top of the soil to the extraction well: inactivation of the microorganisms and their adsorption to the soil particles in the subsurface. Both processes are influenced by a variety of factors and conditions present at a given site. To mention are here properties of (i) The soil: consistence and texture of surfaces, electric charge, hydrophobicity, degree of moisture, coating with organic material. (ii) The groundwater: temperature, pH, presence of cations and ionic strength, presence of organic substances, dissolved oxygen content, activity of indigenous microorganisms. (iii) The microorganisms: forming of flagella, fimbria, hydrophobicity of the cell surface, forming of extracellular polymeric substances, forming of cysts and spores as survival strategies. In addition to the description of the microbial diversity in the subsurface, the sources of pollution and the factors controlling the microbial pathways into groundwater and wells, main methods for the detection of a variety of contaminating microorganisms are given at the end of the report.},

Two vertically stacked modules were tested at pilot-scale at Anjou Recherche under typical biological operating conditions (mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (MLSS) = 10 g/l; sludge retention time (SRT) = 28 days; food to microorganism ratio (F/M) = 0.12 kg COD/kg MLSS/d). The use of a double-deck and of specific backwashes for this membrane technology enabled to achieve satisfying membrane performances for a net flux of 25 L h-1m-2, 20°C at a low specific aeration demand per membrane surface (SADm = 0.2Nm3 h-1m-2) which corresponds to a specific aeration demand per permeate volume unit (SADp) of 8Nm3 air/m3 permeate, which is lower than reported for many commercial membrane systems. The mixed liquor characteristics (foaming, MLSS concentration) appeared to influence the fouling behaviour of the membranes but no correlation was found with the fouling rate. However, with the new operating conditions, the system is robust and can cope with fouling resulting from biological stress and daily peak flows for MLSS concentrations in the membrane tank up to 18 g/l.},

Geochemical analysis of the pond water, suction cup water and groundwater showed that during summer, nitrate and manganese reducing conditions dominate as long as saturated conditions prevail. Iron and sulphate reduction occur only locally. When the sediment below the pond becomes unsaturated, atmospheric oxygen penetrates from the pond margins leading to re-oxidation of previously formed sulphide minerals and enhanced mineralisation of sedimentary particulate organic carbon. The latter promotes the dissolution of calcite. During winter, both the saturated and the unsaturated stage were characterised by aerobic conditions. Thereby, nitrification of sedimentary bound nitrogen could now be observed because nitrate is not immediately consumed, as is the case during summer. This suggests that nitrification below the pond might be less affected by seasonal temperature changes than nitrate reduction.},

   abstract = {Artificial recharge of groundwater is often used to either purify partially treated wastewater or to enhance the quality of surface water by percolation through a variably saturated zone. In many cases, the most substantial purification process within the infiltration water is the redox-dependent biodegradation of organic substances. The present study was aimed at understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of the redox reactions that develop below an artificial recharge pond near Lake Tegel, Germany. At this site, like at many artificial recharge sites, the hydraulic regime immediately below the pond is characterised by cyclic changes between saturated and unsaturated conditions. These changes, which occur during each operational cycle, result from the repeated formation of a clogging layer at the pond bottom. Regular hydrogeochemical analyses of groundwater and seepage water in combination with continuous hydraulic measurements indicate that NO3 - and Mn-reducing conditions dominate beneath the pond as long as water-saturated conditions prevail. Manganese-, Fe- and SO24 -reducing conditions are confined to a narrow zone directly below the clogging layer and in zones of lower hydraulic conductivity. The formation of the clogging layer leads to a steady decrease of the infiltration rate, which ultimatively causes a shift to unsaturated conditions below the clogging layer. Atmospheric O2 then starts to penetrate from the pond fringes into this region, leading to: (i) the re-oxidation of the previously formed sulphide minerals and (ii) the enhanced mineralisation of sedimentary particulate organic C. The mineralisation of sedimentary particulate organic C leads to an increased H2CO3 production and subsequent dissolution of calcite.},

Breakthrough of phenazone at monitoring wells occurred primarily during the warmer summer months, when anaerobic conditions developed. Assuming a redoxsensitive phenazone degradation behavior the model results provided an excellent agreement between simulated and measured phenazone concentrations. Therefore, the fate of phenazone was shown to be indirectly controlled by the infiltration water temperature through its effect on the aquifer’s redox conditions. Other factors such as variable residence times appeared to be of less importance.},

Among a range of recharging techniques, single-well aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is becoming a common option to either augment drinking water supplies or facilitate reuse of reclaimed water. For the present study a conceptual biogeochemical model for reclaimed water ASR was developed and incorporated into an existing reactive multicomponent transport model. The conceptual and numerical model for carbon cycling includes various forms of organic and inorganic carbon and several reactive processes that transfer carbon within and across different phases. The major geochemical processes considered in the model were microbially mediated redox reactions, driven by the mineralization of organic carbon, mineral dissolution/ precipitation, and ion exchange. The numerical model was tested and applied for the analysis of observed data collected during an ASR field experiment at Bolivar, South Australia. The model simulation of this experiment provides a consistent interpretation of the observed hydrochemical changes. The results suggest that during the storage phase, dynamic changes in bacterial mass have a significant influence on the local geochemistry in the vicinity of the injection/extraction well. Farther away from the injection/extraction well, breakthrough of cations is shown to be strongly affected by exchange reactions and, in the case of calcium, by calcite dissolution.},

Due to the practice of water recycling through a semi-closed urban water cycle, the introduction of effluent organic matter (EfOM) and persistent trace organic pollutants in the drinking water is of potential concern. In the work reported herein, the research objectives are to study the removal of bulk and trace organics at bank filtration and artificial recharge sites and to assess important factors of influence for the Berlin area. The monthly analytical program is comprised of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance (UVA254), liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), differentiated adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and single organic compound analysis of a few model compounds. More than 1 year of monitoring was conducted on observation wells located along the flowpaths of the infiltrating water at two field sites that have different characteristics regarding redox conditions, travel time, and travel distance. Two transects are highlighted: one associated with a bank filtration site dominated by anoxic/anaerobic conditions with a travel time of up to 4–5 months, and another with an artificial recharge site dominated by aerobic conditions with a travel time of up to 50 days. It was found that redox conditions and travel time significantly influence the DOC degradation kinetics and the efficiency of AOX and trace compound removal.},

It was found that the kinetics of DOC-degradation depend significantly on the dominant redox conditions during infiltration. A faster mineralization of biodegradable DOC was observed during oxic soil passage (~1 month). Anoxic infiltration led to a comparable residual DOC-concentration, but 3-6 months were required for complete removal of biodegradable DOC (BDOC). LC-OCD measurements revealed that the fraction of polysaccharides (PS) is removed very fast during infiltration in the field. Under strictly anoxic conditions the PS were more stable. The fractions of humic substances, building blocks and low molecular weight acids were degraded partially, independently from the redox potential, while the change in aromaticity of the residual DOC was influenced by the dominant redox conditions.},

The can occur in surface waters wordwide and have to be removed sufficiently when using infested surface waters as drinking water source. Bank filtration has been used since 150 years for drinking water (pre-)treatment and utilizes natural elimination processes like sorption and degardation in the sub-surface. During several research projects the German Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) carried out field investigations and experiments in different scales in order to assess under which conditions secure elimination of microcystins (the most common group of cyanobacterial toxins) takes place. Filtration of cells on the sediment surface is the most prominent process for eliminating the primarily cell-bound toxins. Middle to coarsly grained sands eliminated more than 99.9 % of intracellular toxins within the first 10 centimeters. Elimination of extracellular microcystin during underground passage is mainly due to biodegradation. Reversible adsorption processes do not reduce the total load but lead to longer contact times for extended biodegradation. Laboratory experiments showed that high clay and silt content is crucial for maximum adsorption. However, redox conditions play an important role for degradation rates: under aerobic conditions half lives of less than one day occured frequently whereas anoxic conditions resulted in lag phases of one day and more as well as in half lives of up to 25 days. Field experiments could show that temperature is crucial for degradation velocity under natural conditions.},

With regard to improved source water quality in Europe, the millennium development goals and global climate change, aquifer recharge (AR) and bank filtration (BF) need to be reassessed in terms of sustainability and their role within an integrated water resource management. Based on the IC-NASRI study comprising 194 drinking water facilities worldwide integrating aquifer recharge techniques in their treatment system, an average AR/BF site would be located in Central Europe alongside a river and is characterized by: a sandy gravel aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 2x10-3 m/s, a maximum aquifer thickness of 30 m, 175 m travel distance from bank to well, a travel time of 70 days and by vertical well operation with a daily capacity of 55.000 m³. A literature survey conducted within the TECHNEAU project demonstrated that for substances highly relevant to newly-industrialized or developing countries (e.g. pathogens) the removal efficiency is good. Hydro-chemical analyses from three study sites in Delhi support these results. However, it was also shown that poor surface water quality, saline groundwater or subsurface conditions leading to mobilization of trace metals like iron, manganese or arsenic may limit the applicability of AR / BF without further post-treatment. Climate change might affect the performance of AR / BF worldwide, impairing source water quality and influencing removal efficiency. However, other factors like changes in demography or land-use can impact the systems by far more severely.},

   abstract = {The Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform (WssTP) was initiated by the European commission in 2004 and developed by the European Water Industry, open to all stakeholders. The objective is to stimulate a collaborative, innovative, visionary and integrated research and technology development strategy for the European water sector. Within different pilot programmes of the WssTP Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) was identified as a topic of interest and area relevant for further research. For this reason a Task Force on MAR was initiated in 2009 with 36 representatives from European research institutes, industry partners and with participation of international experts. During a workshop conducted in Graz in June 2009 these experts developed the basis for a report that has now been submitted to the European Commission for consideration in future research calls. In this report MAR was identified as a possible countermeasure against degradation of groundwater resources in Europe, that has a history of more than 150 years of practical implementation in Europe. Although not generating “new” water resources, it enables the use of alternative resources that would not be used otherwise (e.g. storm-water, seasonal high water flow, recycled water) for drinking water and irrigation by buffering high variations in availability and demand. MAR also provides an additional purification step in the regional water cycle. Recharged water can also act as an hydraulic barrier to prevent saltwater intrusion or the spreading of contaminated groundwater and inhibit a regional decrease of groundwater tables. This is particularly important in the scope of achieving the goals of the EU water framework directive. Research needs were identified in the field of defining “Best Management Practices” and standards for MAR in Europe, modelling for transparent feasibility assessment and the investigation of MAR in karstic aquifers.},

   abstract = {Artificial Recharge (AR) is a method to replenish groundwater in case of insufficient water availability or poor quality. For drinking water production, AR is often used as water purification step to avoid direct surface water abstraction. Besides physical filtration, purification is achieved through chemical processes like precipitation, sorption and (bio-) degradation. These are usually closely linked to redox conditions. It is the activity of micro-organisms and related chemical reactions that change the redox conditions, which in turn control the presence of substances and therefore the water quality. Typical pollutants in surface water that need to be addressed are organic compounds (e.g. pharmaceutical residues or pesticides), pathogens and heavy metals. The purpose of this report is to introduce the theoretical background on redox zoning in infiltration ponds and to review publications in the search for applicable methods capable of controlling redox conditions. This shall serve as basis for further laboratory and technical scale experiments in the course of the OXIRED project. The “optimal redox zonation” for maximum removal of redox-dependent substances is a concept with the aim of defining optimum residence times based on the degradation kinetics of contaminants in the source water: If substances or substance groups that show enhanced removal under anoxic to anaerobic conditions are not present in the source water at drinking water relevant concentrations, anoxic to anaerobic conditions should be avoided in order not to mobilize iron and other inorganic trace elements. Maximum benefit for aerobic subsurface passage is reached after 30 d, for anoxic / anaerobic subsurface passage after 100 d. However, already 15 d of aerobic and 2 d of anoxic / anaerobic passage lead to substantial removal or redox-sensitive substances or substance groups. The main drivers for redox zonation in AR systems are the availability of oxidizing agents (oxygen, nitrate), of reducing agents (organic matter, reduced mineral phases), of nutrients, the biological activity (in infiltration pond and subsurface), and the residence time. These drivers are in turn controlled by many natural, site-specific (exogenous) and design & operation-related (decision) variables. Exogenous variables are e.g. aquifer geochemistry, temperature or natural groundwater recharge whereas the decision variables comprise factors such as pond geometry, distance between pond and well, well depth, pumping rate etc. Theoretically, a wide range of possibilities could be applied to adjust the infiltration pond, the hyporheic zone and the subsurface passage, but only few seem technically feasible. These are e.g. the control of sunlight and temperature in the infiltration pond and upper sediment, the control of water movement in the pond to avoid excessive algal growth while enriching the water with oxygen. For the same reason nutrients could be added or avoided, influencing biomass production. Specific filter material could be used with defined content and characteristic of organic carbon to serve as electron acceptors. Infiltration rates could be controlled by adjusting the hydraulic head in order to enhance the formation of an unsaturated zone. Further downstream the application of redox controlling substances via injection wells could be possible, as well as controlling the residence times by adjusting pumping rates or creating hydraulic barrier wells at different distances from infiltration pond. For newly constructed AR systems the well field design (pond geometry, distance between pond and well, well depth) could be optimized with respect to redox zonation, as long as the other requirements (mainly sufficient production rates) are met. No examples for redox control in infiltration ponds were identified. Therefore, two examples of redox control measures are described: the first serves an artificial reoxidation of a polluted aquifer “BIOXWAND®” and the second provides injection of treated water to influence the redox conditions in the aquifer “Vyridox” and “Nitridox”.},

Dies erfolgt beispielsweise bei der Uferfiltration oder künstlichen Grundwasseranreicherung zur Trinkwassergewinnung, bei der Klarwasserverregnung zur weiteren Abwasserreinigung und -nutzung oder bei der Injektion von Süßwasser als hydraulische Barriere in Salzwasserintrusionsgefährdete Grundwasserleiter. Dabei nutzt man nicht nur den mengenmäßigen Ausgleich von überbeanspruchten Grundwasserressourcen, sondern auch die Reinigungsleistung des Untergrundes für eine naturnahe und meist auch kostengünstige Wasseraufbereitung. In Berlin, wo seit über 150 Jahren Trinkwasser mittels Uferfiltration gewonnen wird, wurden in Zusammenarbeit mit den Berliner Universitäten in der Vergangenheit umfangreiche Untersuchungen zur Stoffelimination bei der Untergrundpassage durchgeführt. Diese zeigten, dass auch die Konzentrationen von organischen Spurenstoffen häufig bei der Infiltration oder weiteren Grundwasserleiterpassage zurückgehen. Eine statistische Auswertung von Beobachtungen an verschiedenen Standorten ergab, dass die Mehrheit der untersuchten Substanzen wie beispielsweise Clofibrinsäure, Diclofenac und Phenazon bevorzugt unter oxischen Bedingungen abgebaut werden oder generell eine gute Entfernung erfahren. Einige wie z.B. Carbamazipin oder Sulfamethoxazol werden vor allem unter anoxisch- bis anaeroben Bedingungen entfernt. Aus diesen Beobachtungen ergab sich die Frage, ob ein optimaler Redoxzustand bzw. eine optimal Redoxabfolge für Systeme wie Infiltrationsbecken definiert werden könnte. Erste theoretische Studien erfolgten auf der Basis verfügbarer Abbaukinetiken und unter Einbeziehung weiterer Redox-sensitiver Wasserinhaltsstoffe wie Nitrat und Eisen. Diese ergaben, dass eine Aufenthaltszeit von 30 Tagen im aeroben Milieu und 100 Tagen im anoxischen Milieu während der Untergrundpassage zu einer optimalen Entfernung Redox-sensitiver Problemstoffe führt. Jedoch können bereits 15 Tage aerobe und 2 Tage anoxische / anaerobe Untergrundaufenthalt zu einem deutlichen Rückgang dieser Stoffe führen. Generell sollte jedoch berücksichtigt werden, dass unter anoxischen bis anaeroben Bedingungen mit einer Mobilisierung geogener Spurenelemente wie Eisen und Mangan zu rechnen ist. Obwohl theoretisch eine Vielzahl an Möglichkeiten existiert, den Infiltrationsbereich, die hyporheische Zone und die Untergrundpassage im Hinblick auf eine optimierte Redoxzonierung zu modifizieren oder gar zu steuern, sind nur wenige technisch tatsächlich machbar. Weitere Untersuchungen sollen nun diejenigen Möglichkeiten identifizieren, die in die Praxis übertragbar sind und zu einer Optimierung der künstlichen und natürlichen Systeme zur Infiltration beitragen könnten.},

   abstract = {It was the aim of the EU funded research project TECHNEAU to investigate the relevance and feasibility of bank filtration (BF) plus post-treatment for newly industrialised and developing countries. Field studies at BF sites in Delhi (India) were supplemented by literature studies and modelling in order to investigate if this natural drinking water (pre-) treatment is a sustainable option to provide safe drinking water for countries like India. The results showed that especially for those substances that are of relevance in newly industrialised and developing countries subsurface passage can represent an efficient barrier. However, certain limiting factors for BF application also need to be considered: high ammonium levels in surface water, usually associated with high shares of poorly or un-treated sewage, will not be mitigated during subsurface passage and require extensive post-treatment. In order to support decision makers in the difficult task of assessing the feasibility of BF systems at a certain site a simple decision support system was developed. This simple tool enables to assess a range of abstraction rates and well locations for a specific field site that could fit with their needs (e.g. minimum required travel time or share of BF).},

Durch eine Untergrundpassage mit einer Dauer von meist mehreren Wochen erhält es eine Aufreinigung, die den Aufwand der konventionellen Trinkwasseraufbereitung verringert und eine zusätzliche Barriere gegenüber Schadstoffen darstellt (Kühn 2001). Das Ziel eines interdisziplinären Forschungsvorhabens mit dem Titel NASRI (Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration) war, die Reinigungsprozesse für verschiedenste Substanzen zu ermitteln und Empfehlungen für das zukünftige Wassermanagement in Berlin abzuleiten (Fritz 2003). Aufgabe der Arbeitsgruppe des Umweltbundesamtes war dabei zu klären, wie wirksam Microcystinen (MCYST) als wichtigste Gruppe der Cyanobakterientoxine durch die Bodenpassage eliminiert werden. Im Folgenden werden einige Schlüsselergebnisse berichtet. Für eine ausführliche Ergebnisdarstellung siehe Grützmacher et al. (2006). MCYST sind in der Regel überwiegend (> 90 %) zellgebunden, so dass die physikalische Filtration der Zellen an der Sedimentoberfläche als Eliminationsprozess im Vordergrund steht (Grützmacher et al. 2003). Das extrazelluläre MCYST wird dagegen überwiegend biologisch abgebaut (Lahti et al. 1998, Grützmacher et al. 2005a). Um unter naturnahen Bedingungen Extremfälle für den biologischen Abbau zu simulieren, wurden i) Freilandversuche unter variierenden Redoxbedingungen und ii) Laborsäulenversuche bei unterschiedlichen Temperaturen durchgeführt.

   abstract = {Microcystins (MCYST) are a group of toxic substances produced by cyanobacteria (‘blue-green-algae’). In case of cyanobacterial blooms microcystin concentrations in surface waters may reach values far above the value proposed as provisional guideline for drinking water by the WHO of 1 µg/L for MCYST-LR. For drinking water production via underground passage it is therefore necessary to ensure removal to a large extent. For this reason experiments with extracellular microcystins were conducted in the laboratory as well as in a natural setting on the UBA’s (German Federal Environmental Agency) experimental field for simulation of underground passage. Laboratory batch experiments showed that adsorption of microcystins can be neglected in sandy material (kd < 1 cm³/g). Batch and column experiments identified biodegradation as the predominant elimination process in these sediments. The degradation rates derived from laboratory column experiments as well as semi-technical scale enclosure experiments varied between 0.2 d–1 and 18 d–1. In the worst case this means a half life of 2.8 days, so that under aerobic conditions contact times of several days should be sufficient to eliminate MCYST to an extent safe for use as drinking water.},

   year = {2008},
   abstract = {The project “Organic Trace Substances Relevant for Drinking Water – Assessing their Elimination through Bank Filtration (TRACE)” aims at giving an up-to-date overview of the potential risk resulting from the occurrence of chelating agents, perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and selected pesticides in surface waters and to show if there is a potential for the substances to persist during bank filtration and artificial recharge. During the first phase of the project which is subject of this paper, a literature study was conducted addressing their occurrence (in the Berlin region and elsewhere), amounts produced as well as data on their persistence in the subsurface. This was the basis for a decision on the substance applied in the field scale experiments at the UBAs experimental field during the following project phase. Using freely available databases (e.g. ULIDAT, DIMDI, Tiborder) 1148 references were screened for their relevance to these topics, and 450 of these were classified as relevant. Of these, so far the 223 most important references have been compiled in an ACCESS database which comprises data on the data origin as well as on specific values (e.g. measured concentrations, amounts produced, use, main metabolites, sources, pathways in the environment). The database links this information so that output forms (“fact sheets”) can be created that summarize all data for one specific substance. The regarded substances were subsequently classified according to the criteria: usage / production, occurrence in surface water (if possible also in groundwater and bank filtrate), degradation potential, biological degradability, production of relevant metabolites and toxicity. For the chelating agents three substance groups were examined closely: aminocarboxylates, hydrocarboxylates and phosphonates (all other substance groups were found to be irrelevant due to total biodegradability). The aminocarboxylates are produced in highest numbers and occur most frequently (especially EDTA, PDTA, NTA and DTPA). There are, however, already extensive investigations on this field so that few knowledge gaps were identified. Hydrocarboxylates are produced in lesser amounts and for some ready biological degradability has been shown. For these reasons further investigations were not seen as a priority. Phosphonates produce relevant metabolites (phosphates that enhance eutrophication) and are produced in high amounts (> 1000 t/a). This substance group was therefore recommended for further investigations. Currently a variety of research projects cover the field of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) that occur in aquatic environments world wide and whose toxicity and persistence is not yet clearly determined. Most investigations aim at the main substances of this group: PFOA and PFOS. These are, however, currently being replaced by shorter chained PFCs on which investigations are lacking. This substance group is therefore also of interest for further investigations. For the pesticides glyphosate and isoproturone high production rates and frequent occurrence in surface and groundwater world wide were determined. Due to this fact and to the presence of relevant metabolites (e.g. AMPA) as well as to limited knowledge on their fate during underground passage these substances were classified as highly interesting for further investigations.},

For secure drinking water production from surface waters infested by microcystins removal has to be ensured in a wide variety of cases met in the field. It was therefore the aim of experiments in technical and semitechnical scale on the UBA’s experimental field in Berlin to test some worst case scenarios for the reliability of microcystin elimination during sand passage. Experiments were conducted with virgin sand (no previous contact to MCYST) and high filtration rates as well as under anaerobic conditions. The results show that the greatest problem for MCYST elimination can be found under anaerobic conditions as degradation is not complete and may lead to harmful residual concentrations.},

To obtain parameters for estimating whether MCYST breakthrough is likely in field settings, we tested MCYST elimination in laboratory experiments (batch experiments, column experiments) under a range of conditions. Adsorption coefficients (kd-values) obtained from batch studies ranged from 0.2 mL/g for filter sand to 11.6 mL/g for fine grained aquifer materials with 2% fine grains (<63 µm) and 0.8% organic matter. First order degradation rates in column studies reached 1.87 d-1 under aerobic conditions and showed high variations under anoxic conditions (<0.01-1.35 d-1). These results show that, next to sediment texture, redox conditions play an important role for MCYST elimination during sediment passage.

Currently 700 production wells, located along the banks produce more than 200 Mio m³/a of drinking water, which is treated only for iron and manganese removal before distribution. This is due to the fact that different natural treatment processes (e.g. straining of particles, adsorption or biodegradation) occur during subsurface passage so that post-treatment effort is reduced. Compared to other bank filtration sites world wide, the situation in Berlin is characterized by low hydraulic conductivities but nevertheless high capacities. Interdisciplinary research projects have shown that travel times and redox conditions during subsurface passage are highly transient due to seasonal effects and discontinuous pump operation. Trace organics like pharmaceuticals and x-ray contrast media that occur in Berlin’s surface waters due to relevant shares of treated waste water are attenuated during subsurface passage to varying degree. Substances that were found to be poorly attenuated under oxic conditions or even persistent include carbamazipine, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, 1,5 NDSA, MTBE and EDTA. Under anoxic to anaerobic conditions others like phenazone and diclofenac show little removal. However, none of these substances occur at relevant concentrations in the finished drinking water due to low initial concentrations or additional removal during post-treatment.

One must assume that clogging is regulated by both the build-up and the input of particulate organic matter (POM). In the present study, we collected samples from the littoral zone of Lake Tegel, Berlin, Germany, to analyze relevant carbon turnover processes. High concentrations of POM were detected in the upper sediment layer, with 3.4% ds down to 20 centimeters depth. A very high biomass of interstitial algae was found in the first 5 cm of sediment (25 µg Chl a per cm–3); this was 1000 times higher than in the lake water. The pore system of the sediment was filled to about 50% with POM, and the algae volume comprised about 25 % of POM. Only low amounts of POM were transported from the lake water downwards into the interstices, and the transport of FPOM (a few centimeters per day) was much lower than the water flow (32–260 cm d–1). The DOC concentrations in lake water (~8 mg L–1) and interstitial water (~6 mg L–1) were determined by the in situ bioactivity of interstitial organisms in addition to DOC input from lake water.},

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms behind the dispersal of this species. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phylogeography and mechanisms underlying the recent expansion of C. raciborskii into temperate latitudes, but there is still no conclusive evidence whether the obvious ecological success of C. raciborskii is due to selection mechanisms, physiological tolerance, climatic change or radiation after the last ice age. In this study, new isolates of C. raciborskii from Europe and Africa were genetically characterized by sequencing the ITS1, PC-IGS, nifH and rpoC1 genes and compared to corresponding sequences of C. raciborskii available in GenBank in order to test different phylogeographical hypotheses. The strains were also morphologically examined and screened for production of the hepatotoxic cylindrospermopsin (CYN). We clearly demonstrate that there are phylogenetic, morphological and toxicological differences between the isolated strains. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a clustering of the strains due to geographic origin. The ITS1 and nifH genes separated into American, European and Australian-African groups, whereas the PC-IGS and rpoC1
separated into American and European/Australian/African groups. Our findings do not strongly support any of the existing hypotheses on the phylogeography of C. raciborskii, and  most likely a combination of these hypotheses is the best approach to understand the evolution and dispersal of this species.},

   abstract = {The usage of membranes in wastewater treatment often leads to problems with scaling and fouling, which results in an irreversible loss of membrane permeability. Various pretreatments as well as mechanical and chemical cleaning possibilities are described and evaluated in order to ensure continuous operation. The cleaning has been performed by a sequential backwash with filtrate. In addition, the membrane was cleaned chemically to restore the flux to an acceptable level. The effect of chemically enhanced backwash (CEB) and cleaning in place (CIP) has been considered in more detail. The UF membranes are typically cleaned by soaking in alkali, acids and/or oxidizing solutions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and acid sulphur (H2SO4) were used as cleaning agents. Furthermore, the impact of pre-treatment by pre-ozonation and subsequent coagulation on the performance of a polyether sulphone ultrafiltration membrane has been investigated in a pilot plant. Ozone is used in water treatment for the oxidation of organic substances, which leads to a reduction of organic fouling. A subsequent coagulation is applied to form stable aggregates out of biopolymers, which are most relevant for membrane fouling in order to backwash them easily from the surface and the membrane pores. Both pre-treatments have an influence on an improved filtration performance. The scope of the current paper is to critically evaluate the impact on the hydraulic and chemical treatment of an organic membrane and to find out which cleaning strategy is the best against membrane fouling.},

In some investigations carried out in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, England, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the U.S., more than 80 compounds, pharmaceuticals and several drug metabolites, have been detected in the aquatic environment. Several PhACs from various prescription classes have been found at concentrations up to the μg/l-level in sewage influent and effluent samples and also in several surface waters located downstream from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). The studies show that some PhACs originating from human therapy are not eliminated completely in the municipal STPs and are, thus, discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. Under recharge conditions, polar PhACs such as clofibric acid, carbamazepine, primidone or iodinated contrast agents can leach through the subsoil and have also been detected in several groundwater samples in Germany. Positive findings of PhACs have, however, also been reported in groundwater contaminated by landfill leachates or manufacturing residues. To date, only in a few cases PhACs have also been detected at trace-levels in drinking water samples. },

   abstract = {The behaviour of residues of antibiotic drugs during bank filtration was studied at a field site in Berlin, Germany, where bank-filtered water is used for the production of drinking water. The neighbouring surface water used for bank filtration is under the influence of treated municipal wastewater. Seven out of 19 investigated antimicrobial residues were found in the surface water with median concentrations between 7 and 151 ng L¡1. Out of the seven analytes detected in the surface water only three (anhydroerythromycin, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole) were found with median concentrations above their limits of quantitation in bank filtrate with a travel time of one month or less. With the exception of sulfamethoxazole, none of the 19 analytes were present in bank filtrate with a residence time larger than one month or in the water-supply well itself. Sulfamethoxazole found with a median concentration of 151 ng L¡1 in the surface water was the most persistent of all antimicrobial residues. Nevertheless, it was also removed by more than 98% and only found with a median concentration of 2 ng L¡1 in the water-supply well. The degradation of clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole appear to be redox-dependent. Clindamycin was eliminated more effi­ciently under oxic infiltration conditions while sulfamethoxazole was eliminated more rapidly under anoxic infiltration conditions. A slight preference for an improved degradation under oxic (clarithromycin and roxithromycin) or anoxic (anhydroerythromycin) conditions was also observed for the macrolide antibiotics. Nevertheless, all macrolides were readily removable by bank filtration both under oxic and anoxic conditions.},

Nevertheless, physical, chemical, and biological processes of the removal of impurities are not understood sufficiently. A research project titled Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration attempts to provide more clarity in the processes affecting the removal of these contaminants. The project focuses on the fate and transport of selected emerging contaminants during bank filtration at two transects in Berlin, Germany. Several detections of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in ground water samples from bank filtration sites in Germany led to furthering research on the removal of these compounds during bank filtration. In this study, six PhACs including the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone, the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone, and the drug metabolites clofibric acid and 1-acetyl–1-methyl–2-dimethyloxamoyl– 2-phenylhydrazide were found to leach from the contaminated streams and lakes into the ground water. These compounds were also detected at low concentrations in receiving public supply wells. Bank filtration either decreased the concentrations by dilution (e.g., for carbamazepine and primidone) and partial removal (e.g., for diclofenac), or totally removed PhACs (e.g., bezafibrate, indomethacine, antibiotics, and estrogens). Several PhACs, such as carbamazepine and especially primidone, were readily transported during bank filtration. They are thought to be good indicators for evaluating whether surface water is impacted by contamination from municipal sewage effluent or whether contamination associated with sewage effluent can be transported into ground water at ground water recharge sites.},

The analysis shows that there are large differences between the countries that have a decisive impact on the economic attractiveness of the different options. While electricity use for self-supply is favored in case of high purchase costs for grid electricity (e.g. Germany), subsidy schemes for grid supply can also make this option economically relevant. In all countries, the grid injection of biomethane is a viable option which will be increasingly attractive for WWTP operators in the future. Reliable legal frameworks are required to offer stability for longterm investment at WWTP level, which is today often not the case due to the dynamic nature of the energy markets and policies.},

In the literature of sewer asset management, SVM has been a useful tool to predict and forecast the structural condition of pipes. In this work, the use of differential evolution method as optimization tool was implemented to find the optimal hyper-parameters for SVM models. The SVM models were applied in the main cities of Colombia (Bogota and Medellin) given as a result that the optimized SVM model provides less than 5% of deviation in the prediction of structural conditions in both cities.},

   abstract = {Fecal indicator organisms such as Escherichia coli, enterococci, and coliphages are important to assess, monitor, and predict microbial water quality in natural freshwater ecosystems. To improve predictive modelling of fecal indicators in surface waters, it is vital to assess the influence of autochthonous and allochthonous environmental factors on microbial water quality in riverine systems. To better understand how environmental conditions influence the fate of fecal indicators under varying weather conditions, the interdependencies of environmental parameters and concentrations of E. coli, intestinal enterococci, and somatic coliphages were studied at two rivers (Rhine and Moselle in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) over a period of 2 years that exhibited contrasting hydrological conditions. Both riverine sampling sites were subject to similar meteorological conditions based on spatial proximity, but differed in hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry, thus providing further insight into the role of river-specific determinants on fecal indicator concentrations. Furthermore, a Bayesian multiple linear regression approach that complies with the European Bathing Water Directive was applied to both rivers’ datasets to test model transferability and the validity of microbial water quality predictions in riverine systems under varying flow regimes. According to multivariate statistical analyses, rainfall events and high water discharge favored the input and dissemination of fecal indicators in both rivers. As expected, concentrations declined with rising global solar irradiance, water temperature, and pH. While variations in coliphage concentrations were predominantly driven by hydro-meteorological factors, bacterial indicator concentrations were strongly influenced by autochthonous biotic factors related to primary production. This was more pronounced under low flow conditions accompanied by strong phytoplankton blooms. Strong seasonal variations pointed towards bacterial indicator losses due to grazing activities. The Bayesian linear regression approach provided appropriate water quality predictions at the Rhine sampling site based on discharge, global solar irradiance, and rainfall as fecal indicator distributions were predominantly driven by hydro-meteorological factors. Assessment of microbial water quality predictions implied that rivers characterized by strong hydrodynamics qualify for multiple linear regression models using readily measurable hydro-meteorological parameters. In rivers where trophic interactions exceed hydrodynamic influences, such as the Moselle, viral indicators may pose a more reliable response variable in statistical models.},

   abstract = {Organische Spurenstoffe, wie Pharmazeutikrückstände, werden durch die konventionellen Reinigungsschritte der kommunalen Kläranlagen nur unzureichend entfernt und können in die aquatische Umwelt sowie ins Trinkwasser gelangen. Ozon stellt eine Möglichkeit zur Elimination dieser Spurenstoffen aus Kläranlagenabläufen dar. Dabei werden Wasserinhaltsstoffe direkt durch Ozon und indirekt über °OH-Radikale oxidiert und transformiert. Für die Ausstattung einer Kläranlage mit einer Ozonanlage erfolgt oft eine aufwändige und langwierige Pilotierung. Daher ist eine Testmethode im Labormaßstab von Nöten, anhand derer Auslegungsparameter für die Dimensionierung einer Ozonanlage abgelesen werden können. Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein einheitliches Testverfahren entwickelt und der Einfluss der Probenlagerung, der Wassertemperatur bei Versuchsdurchführung, der Wassermatrix und des Gehalts an DOC, Nitrit und abfiltrierbaren Stoffen untersucht. Des Weiteren wurden Methoden zur Vorhersage der Spurenstoffelimination mit Ozon überprüft und bewertet. Die Testmethode eines Semi-Batch-Verfahrens, bei der eine Wasserprobe mit einem Sauerstoff/ Ozon-Gemisch begast wird, wurde mit einem Batch-Verfahren, bei dem eine hochkonzentrierte Ozonlösung der Probe zugegeben wird, verglichen. Batchversuche können mit konstanten oder variablen Verdünnung durchgeführt werden. Dabei wird zu einer gleichbleibenden Menge an Probenlösung eine variierende Menge an Ozonstarkwasser gegeben und diese Lösung bei der konstanten Verdünnung auf einen festgelegten Wert mit voll entsalztem Wasser aufgefüllt, während bei der variablen Verdünnung keine Zugabe von voll entsalztem Wasser erfolgt, so dass variierende Gesamtvolumina entstehen. Zur Bewertung der Ozonung wurde der spektrale Absorptionskoeffizient bei 254nm benutzt, da er den Gehalt an Organik in einer Wasserprobe wiederspiegelt. Es wurde festgestellt, dass beide Versuchs- und Verdünnungsmethoden übereinstimmende Ergebnisse der SAK254-Reduktion und Spurenstoffelimination liefern, das Batchverfahren jedoch einen erheblich geringeren Proben- und Zeitaufwand benötigt. Durch eine zweiwöchige Probenlagerung bei 7 °C konnte ein Anstieg des pH-Wertes beobachtet werden, der jedoch nur eine geringe Erhöhung der Elimination mancher Spurenstoffe, wie Benzotriazol, bewirkte. Des Weiteren führte eine Variation der Wassertemperatur bei der Ozonung von 10 - 30 °C bei Batch-Versuchen zu keiner signifikanten Veränderung der SAK254-Reduktion und Spurenstoffelimination. Zwei Kläranlagenabläufe und Trinkwasser mit unterschiedlichen DOC- und Nitritkonzentrationen wurden verglichen. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass die Korrektur des Ozoneintrags um die Ozonzehrung durch Nitrit und der Bezug auf den DOC ein gutes Instrument darstellt, um unterschiedliche Wassermatrizen vergleichbar zu machen. Während die Kläranlagenabläufe ähnliche Ergebnisse der Spurenstoffelimination liefern, wurde im Trinkwasser eine erhöhte Entfernung von Acesulfam, Benzotriazol, Candesartan, Gabapentin und Valsartansäure gemessen. Dies lässt sich durch die verschiedene Zusammensetzung des organischen Materials und der Menge an als Radikalfängern agierenden Stoffen im Kläranlagenablauf erklären. Zwischen der Spurenstoffelimination in filtriertem (0,45 µm, Cellulosenitrit) und unfiltrietem (AFS ≤ 4 mg/L) Kläranlagenablauf wurde kein Unterschied festgestellt, während eine Zudosierung von suspendierten Stoffen (30 -75 mg/L) eine Verminderung der SAK254-Reduktion sowie der Spurenstoffelimination um bis zu 20% zur Folge hatte. Dies wird durch die Abreaktion des Ozons und der °OH-Radikale an den Partikeln erklärt. Zur Vorhersage der Spurenstoffelimination konnten Diclofenac, Benzotriazol, Valsartan und Iomperol als Indikatorsubstanzen im Kläranlagenablauf identifiziert werden, über die die Elimination weiterer Spurenstoffe genügend genau abgeschätzt werden kann. Darüber hinaus konnte ein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen delta SAK54 und der Elimination jedes Spurenstoffes aufgestellt werden, mit dem die zu erwartende Entfernung bei einem bestimmten Ozoneintrag berechnet werden kann.},

   abstract = {The study aims at validating the point-of-use investigations on long-term gravity-driven ultrafiltration for a scaled-up system, which could produce drinking water for a community of 100-200 inhabitants using natural surface water. Eawag, KWB and Opalium conceived a membrane-based small-scale system (SSS) which can operate without crossflow, backflush, aeration or chemical cleaning. Equipped with a biosand filter as pretreatment, it is designed to be robust, energy-sufficient (gravity-driven) and run with restricted chemical intervention (only residual chlorine). The containerised unit (10’) requires to be fed with raw water at a 2 m-height (energy-equivalent to ~8Wh/m3). As sole operational requirement, the membrane reactor is simply to be drained (i.e. emptied) on daily to weekly basis to superficially remove the material retained by the membrane and accumulated in the module. Otherwise, the system, which is only driven by a 40 cm differential pressure head (i.e. 40 mbar), is totally self-determined and autonomous. This report details the validation tests performed at Veolia Water Research Center in Annet-sur-Marne (France) from January to August 2009 : the gravity-driven UF compact unit showed promising results in regards to flux stabilization and flow capacity. Although early investigations take place in winter, an initial flux stabilization to 2.5 lmh is observed, which is below the reference results from the Eawag lab tests (i.e. 7-10 lmh, at 20 ± 2°C). However, the “scaled-up” system can benefit from a weekly drainage which seems to enhance the flux to 4-5 lmh, and thereby, the unit is to produce more than 4 m3/d, which is consistent with the design target of 5 m3/d. Moreover, the increase of the drainage frequency (to 3 times/week) along with warmer temperatures – leading to a better membrane permeability and biological activity - contribute to a further enhancement to 5-7 lmh. This is particularly relevant for South Africa, for which decentralized water supply is a burning issue and where the unit is to be further tested from November 2009. The investigations also highlighted the critical performance of the biosand filter as pretreatment. More than the UF step – whose membrane integrity was confirmed with bacterial analyses, the pretreatment step needed more frequent (i.e. monthly) O&M requirements. Therefore, the pretreatment necessity will be further assessed in South Africa where high turbidity peaks could represent an extra challenge for the unit.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {Rver Bank Filtration (RBF) is a drinking water (pre-)treatment that can remove a wide variety of surface water contaminants . However, the efficiency of this natural treatment process depends on hydrochemical, aquifer- and operational characteristics. Therefore, complementary treatment options may be required in order to build up a multiple-barrier-system and obtain drinking water quality. As a follow-up to the TECHNEAU WP5.2 field investigations, this report aims at identifying potential post-treatment schemes for drinking water production at three river bank filtration sites in New Delhi - Palla, Nizamuddin and Najarfgarh – for which physicochemical parameters as well as levels of inorganic and trace organic substances and microbial contamination have been measured during field campaigns in 2007 and 2008 (see deliverables D5.2.2 and D5.2.6). The three investigated RBF sites in Delhi have distinctive geographical locations and contamination exposures. For each of them, critical water parameters were identified that present a challenge with regards to drinking water production, for which different treatment technologies are envisaged (see table below). For Palla and Najafgarh, one specific water component (fluoride and salinity, respectively) requires targeted treatment. For Nizamuddinm, however, where surface water is highly exposed to contamination from poorly treated waste water, theoretical post-treatment options are no longer efficient and extensive conventional wastewater treatment is recommended. One other possible option for Nizamuddin is the Oxidation / Biofiltration / Membrane technology (OBM process) developed by NTNU and SINTEF within the TECHNEAU project and a specific report on its application to Delhi is planned within TECHNEAU WP7.9. This report shows the theoretical post-treatment options for river bank filtration sites in Delhi. The strong technological requirements for Nizamuddin and Najafgarh seem inadequate to be currently implemented. The priority in Delhi would be to develop an integrated water and wastewater management, in order to reduce contamination in the surface water and thereby lower the technological requirements for drinking water production.},

As the price of membranes has notably decreased over the last years, the market of membrane-based systems for decentralised applications has developed and diversified. In order to have a view of what the current market offers, 204 water companies were contacted and asked to characterise their Point-of-use (POU) or small-scale membrane systems, with a focus set on operation and maintenance, costs and energy requirements. Such study was not performed previously. With a 15% reply rate, the survey enables to identify the different market niches. That includes ceramic POU, organic POU, organic point-of-entries (POE), modular treatment units and emergency systems, whose technical characterization is further detailed in the Annex. Besides, the review of the marketed membrane modules reveals that ultrafiltration is the most available process. The survey also shows that the pre-treatment is a key parameter when considering options for decentralised water supply. As needs for sustainable solutions for small water supply are established, the membrane market is expected to grow and more standardised products to appear. The market evaluation can be summarized in Figure 1. Depending on the product niche, the membrane material and the filtration type, different degrees toward the market maturity are then highlighted.  Such systems would be broadly applied in developed countries, but they represent also great potential for transition and developing countries. However, few systems designed for long-term operation with low-energy and low-chemical requirements exist yet. Therefore, the R&D identified within Techneau matches a non-fulfilled yet requirement.},

In addition to the project deliverable D2.1 “Literature review on theoretical pump and motor efficiency of submersible pump systems” the availability of innovative and energy saving submersible pumps on the market has to be verified. Therefore, the market has been scanned and evaluated. The purpose of this document is to present the results of the market analysis for efficient pumps and to assess realistic energy saving potentials that are achievable with today’s technology. This achievement can be reached by either selecting more efficient centrifugal pumps or motors (evaluated in this study), or by considering some boundary conditions such as losses in power supply cables, operating mode or the use of variable speed drives. These accompanying conditions were also discussed at the workshop and are presented as a short summary in the last chapter of this paper.},

   abstract = {At Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany, drinking water is produced by induced bank filtration. Under such increased infiltration conditions, it is very important to understand the natural purification processes in the upper littoral zone (sediment depth of about 0–30 cm) in order to maintain a high drinking water quality. We therefore analyzed the pore water and measured the redox potential at Lake Tegel regularly to detect fluctuations in the concentrations of physicochemical parameters due to seasonal variations in the redox potential. The redox potential is not only influenced by the biological activity of the interstitial biocoenosis, but also by hydraulic conditions that occasionally produce unsaturated zones leading to an intrusion of gaseous oxygen. The result is an increase in the redox potential, which declines during the summer due to intensive dissimilatory reduction and microbial activity, thus leading to distinctly anaerobic conditions. When this is the case, the oxygen supplied by primary production and bioturbation cannot meet the oxygen demand needed for the mineralization of organic material. Negative redox values (minimal –200 mV) are accompanied by increases in nitrite (max. conc. 150 µg/L) and ammonium levels (max. conc. 0.45 mg/L), while the nitrate concentrations decreased (min. conc. 0.2 mg/L). This indicates that processes such as denitrification and ammonification occur, and that, after depletion of free oxygen reserves, other electron acceptors, such as nitrate and also heavy metal ions (Fe3+), are used.},

   year = {2014},
   abstract = {According to the European Water Framework Directive, ‘good ecological and chemical status’ must  be achieved for all surface waters by 2015 (European Parliament, 2000). Therefore, it is important to  extend knowledge on pollutants that run off with urban rainwater. This study has the objective to  determine which micropollutants occur in Berlin’s urban rain water run-off and how the most  detrimental pollutants can be managed in a sustainable manner to reduce their impact on receiving  waters.  To reach these objectives, five catchments with different land use characteristics that together  represent Berlin were selected for the collection of rainwater samples. These catchments consisted  of New buildings (New), Old buildings (Old), One family homes (Ofh), Commercial buildings (Com)  and Streets (Str). Actual sampling was done by installing an automated water sampler at each  location, together with a flow measuring device to start the sampler during rain events.  The following number of rain events were sampled and analysed; New (n=8), Old (n=7), Ofh (n=6),  Com (n=11) and Str (n=4). Samples collected during rain events were processed to one volume  proportional composite sample that represents the entire event. This sample was then analysed on  the presence and concentration of micropollutants. With that information, measures where  determined that can be applied for the reduction of pollutant loads.  Micropollutants from the following groups were found during this study; pesticides / biocides,  industrial chemicals, PAH’s, heavy metals, tracers, flame retardants and phthalates.  From these groups, the most detrimental are; Nickel, Diuron, Isoproturon, Cadmium, Lead, PFOA,  PFOS , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), Nonylphenol, DEHP, Zinc, Copper, TCPP, Mecoprop,  Glyphosphat, OHBT and Di-iso-decylphthalat.  To assess measures for micropollutant reduction, the concept of source-path-threatened object was  used to identify where pollutants come from and what pathway they follow to which vulnerable  objects. Possible measures to reduce the load of these substances are banning or substituting the  pollutant by legislation. Furthermore, vegetation infrastructure, decentralized pre-treatment,  infiltration and sedimentation can be applied for reduction of pollutant loads. These measures  should be applied in an integrated manner to enhance one another.  Pollutant characteristics -and thus behaviour in the environment- is one of the most relevant criteria  for the selection of measures to reduce these substances. The most effective approaches for particle  and non-particle bound pollutants are end-of-pipe solutions. These consist of sedimentation systems  for particle bound, and infiltration structures for non-particle bound micropollutants. Emitting  sources (e.g. traffic) and paths (e.g. air) that contribute to pollutants in urban rainwater run-off are  further relevant criteria. These can only be directly reduced by legislation, vegetation infrastructure  can however be applied to reduce the mobility of these pollutants.},

   abstract = {This project report summarizes work conducted in work package 12 of the DEMEAU project. Along with Deliverable 12.1 it covers all tasks from work package 12 as formulated in the Description of Work (DoW). This report contains information about (pre-) feasibility studies, design recommendations and pre-treatment options for different types of MAR. The wide range of hydrogeological features encountered in reality makes a site-by-site approach indispensable. As part of this effort the hydrogeological pre-requisites for surface spreading and deep well injection techniques are described in detail. In chapter 2, ten essential hydrogeological parameters are defined by objective criterias. The following chapter outlines and describes how to obtain these essential hydrogeological parameters. This feasibility assessment starts with the screening of the potential site based on a structured procedure. Site investigations start with relatively cheap but numerous field and laboratory testing and continue to more cost-demanding but less numerous tests. With this procedure it is possible to carry out technical site feasibility in a costand time efficient way. The fourth chapter investigates the International Hydrogeological Map of Europe (IHME 1500) as a planning basis for pre-feasibility of new MAR sites. It was found that the IHME 1500 is useful for a pre-assessment, but detailed regional and local scale maps (and investigations) are additionally necessary to effectively assess hydrogeological features. The final chapter deals with pre-treatment options for MAR. Pre-treatment is necessary to remove critical contaminants from the source water to i) enhance system performance and removal efficiencies, ii) ensure the long-term functioning of the system, iii) meet regulatory demands and iv) ensure beneficial uses of the aquifer beyond the attenuation zone. Available pre-treatment methods in relation to source water type and intended end-use are described. Based on chemical concentrations in source water and intended end-use the most appropriate pre-treatment method can be assessed from a table. Altogether this report thus provides guidance in designing new MAR systems based on a sound hydrogeological site characterisation and pre-feasibility assessment based on available information and parameters obtained from structured investigations.},

   year = {2010},
   abstract = {Subsurface passage as utilized during river bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge has shown to be an effective barrier for multiple substances present in surface waters during drinking water production. Additionally it is widely used as polishing step after wastewater treatment. However, there are limitations concerning the removal of DOC and specific trace organics. The project ”OXIRED“ aims at assessing possibilities to overcome these limitations by combining subsurface passage with pre-oxidation by ozone. In the first phase of the project, laboratory-scale column experiments were conducted in order to quantify removal for different settings under varying conditions. In a previous study different combinations of advanced oxidation and subsurface passage were evaluated concerning their potential removal efficiency and practical implementation on the basis of existing, published experiences and theoretical considerations. Two different scenarios were identified as promising for experiments in laboratory-scale columns with surface water and sewage treatment plant effluent: (A) surface water - oxidation - groundwater recharge and (B) surface water - short bankfiltration - oxidation - groundwater recharge. The investigations were designed to lead to recommendations for the implementation of a combined system of subsurface passage and advanced oxidation in pilot scale experiments that will be carried out in the second phase of the project. Prior to column experiments, batch tests following the RCT-concept by Elovitz and von Gunten (1999) were carried out to characterize the reaction of ozone with the investigated water qualities [1]. Additional batch ozonation tests with subsequent analysis of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) were conducted in order to determine optimal ozone doses for DOC removal in column experiments. For laboratory-scale experiments a set of 8 soil columns (length: 1 m; diameter: 0.3 m) was operated at TUB to evaluate the effects of pre-ozonation of different source waters (secondary effluent, surface water, bank filtrate). Ozonation was conducted with gaseous ozone in a 13-L stirred tank reactor. Specific ozone doses of 0.7 mg O3/mg DOC0 and 0.9 mg O3/mg DOC0 were investigated. Trace organic compounds to be targeted were identified in a prior literature study on existing data on subsurface removal. Results from laboratory-scale soil column experiments led to recommend specific ozone doses (z) of 0.7 mg O3/mg DOC0 for the following technical- and pilot-scale applications. Removal of surface water DOC in the soil columns was increased from 22% without ozonation to 40% (z = 0.7) and 45% (z = 0.9) with preozonation and the DOC in the column effluent reached the level of tap water in Berlin within less than one week of retention time. At bank filtration and artificial recharge sites in Berlin similar removal rates were only observed within 3 - 6 months of retention [2]. The transformation of many trace compounds was efficient with specific ozone doses of 0.6−0.7 mg O3/mg DOC0. Realistic surface water concentrations of carbamazepine,sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and bentazone were reduced below the limits of quantification (LOQ). The pesticides diuron and linuron were reduced close to LOQ. The substances MTBE, ETBE and atrazine were only partly transformed during ozonation. For efficient transformation of these substances, higher ozone doses or an optimisation of the oxidation process, for example as advanced oxidation process (AOP), should be considered. Operating a preceding bank filtration (scenario B) will enhance the transformation efficiency of MTBE and ETBE. With similar ozone consumption the transformation of MTBE and ETBE was increased by 27−31% and 28−33% of the original removal, respectively. Other investigated compounds were efficiently transformed during ozonation of surface water independently of the preceding bank filtration step. For the removal of bulk organic carbon only little improvement was observed for scenario B. Overall DOC removal increased from 45% with direct ozonation of surface water to up to 50% with a preceding soil column. Despite the presence of relevant bromide concentrations (~ 100 µg/L) formation of the oxidation by-product bromate was not observed (< 5 µg/L). However, this could also be a result of analytical problems, as later spiking tests showed. Formation of brominated organic compounds was also not observed. Adsorbable organic bromide (AOBr) even decreased by 50 - 60% for secondary effluent and 80 - 90% for surface water. The reduction of AOBr concentrations was accompanied by an increase of inorganic bromide by up to 40 µg/L during ozonation of surface water. In the two conducted in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test, micronucleus assay) no genotoxicity caused by ozonation of water samples was observed. Testing for cytotoxicity (glucose consumption rate, ROS generation) showed positive results in several samples. However, a systematic attribution of toxic effects to ozonation or subsequent soil passage was not possible. Reasons for cytotoxic effects were not evaluated within the scope of this project but it is assumed that they were caused by unknown cofactors. These results show that the objectives of enhanced removal of trace organics and DOC by combining ozonation and subsurface passage are well met. Further investigations need to confirm this for the pilot scale, especially taking into account the formation, retention and toxicity of oxidation by-products.},

   abstract = {Subsurface passage as utilized during bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge has shown to be an effective barrier for multiple substances present in surface waters during drinking water production. Additionally it is widely used as polishing step after wastewater treatment. However, there are limitations concerning the removal of DOC and specific trace organics. The project ”OXIRED“ aims at assessing possibilities to overcome these limitations by combining subsurface passage with oxidation by ozone. Results from the first phase of the project have demonstrated that oxidation with ozone is a suitable method to reduce the concentrations of several relevant trace organic compounds (e.g. carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole) and to significantly enhance biodegradation of DOC during subsequent soil passage. For efficient removal of DOC in the soil columns, specific ozone consumptions of 0.6 to 0.7 mgO3/DOC0 were sufficient. Project objectives in OXIRED-2 were to i) verify results from laboratory scale experiments at a larger scale with longer retention times, ii) study feasibility under field conditions with seasonal variations by operating a pilot unit, iii) evaluate the formation of oxidation by-products and their persistence during subsurface passage and iv) propose a standardized test protocol to analyse benefits of ozonation and artificial groundwater recharge at different sites.  To investigate effects of ozonation on groundwater recharge with longer retention times, a technical scale column system with a length of 30 m and a hydraulic retention time of approximately six weeks was operated at the UBA’s experimental site in Berlin Marienfelde. Pilot studies were conducted at Lake Tegel using an ozone unit from ITT-Wedeco with a 4 g/h generator and subsequent slow sand filtration. Reduction of bromate was assessed in laboratory scale soil columns under different redox conditions. In addition, anoxic reduction of bromate was evaluated in a diploma thesis at TU Berlin. To analyse effects of DOC removal after ozonation, a standardized test protocol using recirculating columns was proposed and tested. Results from the different experiments confirmed the conclusions of the first phase of the project. Removal of surface water DOC during infiltration significantly increased with preozonation. In pilot studies, effluent DOC of approximately 4.7 mg/L after 1 d of retention time was measured, which is comparable to residual DOC from artificial groundwater recharge in Berlin Tegel after 30 days retention time [1]. In addition, strong effects of temperature on DOC removal were observed. During experiments with ozonation, overall DOC reduction decreased from approximately 40% in October to about 30% in the end of November. Biological testing of slow sand filter effluent revealed no genotoxic or cytotoxic effects in the water prior to further infiltration into the aquifer. Many persistent trace compounds were efficiently transformed during ozonation with specific ozone doses of 0.8 mg O3/mg DOC0. For example, realistic surface water concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, phenazone and bentazone were reduced below the limits of quantification (LOQ). Primidone was only partly transformed during ozonation (70%). Since primidone is persistent during infiltration, a breakthrough in combined ozonation and artificial recharge can be expected. Also the substances MTBE and ETBE, the pesticide atrazine and some metabolites detected in Lake Tegel persist partially during treatment with ozone and subsequent groundwater recharge. For efficient transformation of these substances, higher ozone doses or an optimisation of the oxidation process, for example as advanced oxidation process (AOP), should be considered. Efficient reduction of the concentration of adsorbable organic iodine (AOI), an indicator for x-ray contrast media, during ozonation or infiltration was not observed. In contrast, adsorbable organic bromine decreased by 70 − 80 % during ozonation. Formation of the oxidation by-product bromate during ozonation of Lake Tegel water with a specific ozone consumption of up to 1.0 mg O3/mg DOC0 was below the limit of the German drinking water directive. Removal during subsurface passage was observed under anoxic conditions in presence of biodegradable organic carbon. Since artificial recharge after ozonation is likely aerobic, no significant reduction of bromate can be expected. Thus, formation of bromate needs to be controlled during surface water ozonation. Formation of nitrosamines was monitored in batch experiments with a specific ozone consumption of up to 1.15 mg O3/mg DOC0. No formation of nitrosamines including NDMA (LOQ: 5 ng/L) was observed. Operating a preceding bank filtration step will reduce ozone demand for efficient DOC removal. In addition, problems with particles from source water can be minimised. However, additional energy consumption for operation of extraction wells has to be taken into account. Overall, the presented results confirm that the objectives of enhanced removal of trace organics and DOC by combining ozonation and subsurface passage are well met. Further investigations need to focus on seasonal variations in long-term pilot studies and the formation, retention and toxicity of transformation products.},

This will affect vital factors for water supply such as precipitation regime, groundwater recharge, run-off, river discharge and raw water quality. Projections on climate change and the implications are difficult because of the uncertainties associated with climate scenarios and modelling. However, in Europe and North America where BF is in operation, the projected increase in seasonal floods and droughts has already been experienced. In addition, site-specific considerations (e.g. land use, demographic trends) are to be taken into account to evaluate the potential impacts on water supply.

Due to the easy implementation and little maintenance necessary, BF has been suggested to be a useful drinking water treatment for developing and newly-industrialised countries. Experience from Europe has demonstrated that RBF is suitable to remove a range of organic and inorganic contaminants while an exhaustion of cleaning capacity has not been observed. RBF systems can mitigate shock loads and are particularly known for the efficient removal of pathogens, suspended solids and algal toxins from surface water, all being water quality parameters of high relevance in developing and newly-industrialised countries. Another benefit of RBF operation is the storage capacity which may help to balance freshwater availability in areas experiencing high variations of precipitation and run-off. This report aims at evaluating the relevance and opportunities of RBF systems to provide safe water to these countries. In order to evaluate the relevance and opportunities of RBF systems to developing and newly-industrialised countries, the report is structured to address key considerations and (i) identify prerequisites for successful RBF operation based on the experience in Central Europe and the United States, (ii) assess the removal potential of RBF for various water contaminants based on available literature, the TECHNEAU investigations in India and NASRI data from Berlin and (iii) evaluate the sustainability and relevance of RBF operation with regard to the particular needs in developing and newly-industrialised countries.},

   year = {2014},
   abstract = {The export of agricultural contaminants from agricultural landscapes of the US Midwest has contributed to the impairment of surface waters throughout the Mississippi River Basin and has been linked to various human health concerns. Natural treatment systems (wetlands, bioswales, bioreactors) can capture agricultural runoff and significantly reduce nutrient loading to downstream waters but there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of these treatment systems to attenuate the suite of pollutants (nutrients and synthetic organics) typically found in agricultural runoff. This understanding is important given that the degradation of different pollutants involves metabolic pathways that often require different redox environments. As part of the Aquisafe-2 project, a bioretention swale comprising two treatment cells (a subsurface cell in series with a surface cell) was monitored, and its performance evaluated over a three-year period (2011 - 2013). Results showed that the bioswale was moderately efficient with regard to nitrate (NO3-; retention range: 16-58 %). N removal averaging 30 % was measured during a series of wetting events during which the bioswale operated at an estimated average hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.97 day. Spatial analysis of the data showed that almost all the NO3- removal occurred in the subsurface cell; however, N removal was also measured in the surface cell under low flow conditions (estimated HRT: 2.5 days). The highest rates of N removal (~ 58 %) were measured when the bioswale stayed wet for several days probably due to the development of a more optimum environment for denitrifying microbes. Nitrate removal capacity was limited by NO3- availability, short retention times during high flows, and the frequent fluctuation between oxic and anoxic conditions, but not by water temperature (8.3-16.6 oC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 1.9 - 29.2 mg C L-1). The bioswale performance with regard to soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and atrazine was more variable, with net retention during some periods and net release at other times. The bioswale was a net source of P during most sampling periods with an average SRP release corresponding to 13 % of input, probably due to desorption of water soluble P from the topsoil applied during construction. This interpretation is supported by the progressive decline in P release observed between the first and third year of monitoring. The subsurface and the surface cells contributed almost equally to the fate of P in the bioswale. Likewise, the bioswale was at times a small/moderate sink (13-31 % retention) for atrazine, and a net source (-38 % to -15 %) during periods when the bioswale received overland runoff from the adjacent crop field which bypassed the subsurface cell. Results suggested that competition between atrazine and DOC for sorption sites is a possible mechanism affecting atrazine removal efficiency. Additional work is needed to compare the efficiency of the subsurface and surface cells with regard to atrazine, and elucidate the biogeochemical factors controlling its fate in the bioswale.},

   title = {Effects of vegetation and glyphosate on denitrification in constructed wetlands - Feasibility test of technical scale simulation},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (iv) and evaluates the suitability of the technical scale experimental site at the UBA in Berlin, Marienfelde for simulating processes that impact the fate and transformation of nutrients in wetlands / riparian zones. A 3-month pilot investigation (Sep. to mid Nov. 2007) was conducted in order to assess the impact of vegetation on nitrate (NO3-) removal in slow-sand filters (SSFs) and identifying possible interference of glyphosate with N and C cycling processes in these systems. SSFs are engineered bio-reactors that can mitigate the transfer of a wide range of pollutants including nutrients and organic contaminants to water bodies. Two vertical-flow experimental SSFs (average area: 60 and 68 m2, depth: 0.8 and 1.2 m, respectively) at the UBA facilities in Berlin were used in this study: one unplanted and the other vegetated with Phragmites australis. The SSFs received water amended with nitrate (NO3-) and phosphate (PO4 -) without and with glyphosate (added for 2 weeks). Mineral N concentration at the mixing cell, SSF surface, 40 cm depth and at the SSF outlet was measured at least twice per week to calculate N removal rates. Physical water properties (pH, redox potential, temperature) and greenhouse gas emission (CO2, CH4 and N2O) were also monitored to gain insights into controlling processes. Results showed that N removal rates were several-fold higher in the vegetated than in the non-vegetated SSFs averaging 663 mg N m-2 d-1 (57 % of input) and 114 mg N m-2 d-1 (14 % of input), respectively. In both systems, most of the N removal occurred in the top 40 cm of the SSFs. Marked temporal variation in N removal rates was also detected with rates in general 3 times higher in late summer compared to mid/late autumn. In the latter period, a net release of N was observed in the non-vegetated SSF. The seasonal variation in N removal could be related to a lack of vegetation growth and thus plant N uptake, and may also reflect of the sensitivity of denitrification to climatic factors as suggested by strong (r2 > 0.77) linear relationships between weekly N removal rates and SSF water temperature. A clear impact of glyphosate addition on nitrate concentrations could not be observed. Denitrification, the process most responsible for the removal of nitrogen from waters and soils seems to be unaffected by the addition of glyphosate under the conditions in the experiment. The impact of glyphosate, if any, was probably much smaller compared to the strong influence of temperature on N dynamics in the SSFs. Difficulty of maintaining a constant concentration of glyphosate during dosing may have also contributed to this outcome. Nitrous oxide emission accounted for < 3 % of the total N removed was always lower in the vegetated (< 0.1 - 0.3 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1) than in the non-vegetated SSF (0.2 - 3.8 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1). Conversely, CH4 emission was always higher in the vegetated (range: +0.4 to +49.5 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1) than in the non-vegetated SSF (range: -2.1 to +1.32 mg CH4-C d-1). These results, in connection with much lower oxidation reduction potential readings in the vegetated filter, suggest that the reduction of N2O to N2 was important in the SSF systems and that N2 was the dominant N gas produced. Thus, N2 production must be quantified in order to establish N mass balance of SSF systems. The results show that technical-scale experiments can realistically simulate mitigation systems, while having control over contaminant loading, flow conditions and monitoring. Important lessons learnt for future applications are the following (i) Denitrifying conditions can be established in both SSF of the experimental site by adjusting to low flow conditions (0.23 m³/h) and dosing nitrate. (ii) Dosing of trace contaminants (in this case glyphosate) needs to be improved, but will remain difficult for the large amounts of water involved. The results underline the importance of measurements in the mixing cell. (iii) Since seasonal effects play an important role in mitigation zone performance, any experiments need to be done in parallel, rather than in succession to be able to compare the results.},

This technique could be an alternative water source in response of a climate change context. In this review, the state of this practice worldwide was studied. Some discrepancies between countries have been highlighted. First, between developed and developing countries, gaps concerning techniques and regarding the main purposes (water savings for the first ones and drinking purposes for the last ones) were reported. Then, within developed countries themselves, acceptance and standards of RWH installations are different, with precise guidelines and norms for countries leading the way on RWH practices. The scale of applications (RWH for households – up to 50 inhabitants, for large buildings and for urban area) is discussed and the state of the technique showed that there were more potential of technological development and challenges for large scale systems than for households. Finally, this report draws the attention to the needs in terms of Research and Development projects. Six main aspects were highlighted: drinking water, energy compensation, environmental impacts, economical aspects and the integration of stormwater management and rainwater harvesting. The last feature concerns hygienic aspect, but the report do not focus on this consideration.},

   abstract = {Der vorliegende Abschlussbericht fasst die Ergebnisse des Forschungsvorhabens IST4R (Integration der Spurenstoffentfernung in Technologieansätze der 4. Reinigungsstufe) zusammen, in dem verschiedene Verfahrenskombination von Aktivkohle und Ozonung zur Entfernung von anthropogenen Spurenstoffen als weitergehende Abwasserreinigung untersucht wurden. Dabei stand insbesondere die Integration dieser Verfahren in die Flockungsfiltration zur weitestgehenden Entfernung von Phosphor und abfiltrierbaren Stoffen im Fokus, die eine Planungsvariante zum zukünftigen Ausbau der Berliner Klärwerke darstellt. Ein wesentliches Ziel war die Bewertung der Verfahrensalternativen (1) Direktdosierung von Pulveraktivkohle, (2) Festbettadsorption an granulierte Aktivkohle und (3) Ozonung zur Spurenstoffentfernung, um zukünftige Anforderungen an Oberflächengewässer zu erfüllen. Die mittels Pilotversuchen gewonnenen Ergebnisse verdeutlichen, dass sowohl Ozonung als auch Aktivkohle sinnvoll mit der Flockungsfiltration kombiniert werden können. Alle untersuchten Verfahrensvarianten sind geeignet, den Spurenstoffeintrag kommunaler Kläranlagen signifikant zu verringern und gleichzeitig die Zielwerte für die suspendierten Stoffe (TSS < 1 mg/L) und Gesamtphosphor (TP < 0,1 mg/L) sicher einzuhalten. Es erfolgt eine zusätzliche Entfernung von CSB und DOC. Die Entfernung der einzelnen Spurenstoffe ist stoffspezifisch. Sie ist außerdem abhängig von der Konzentration des im Wasser vorliegenden gelösten organischen Kohlenstoffs (DOC) und der Dosis von Aktivkohle bzw. Ozon, aber unabhängig von der Ausgangskonzentration der Spurenstoffe. Für ausgewählte Indikatorsubstanzen wurden Dosis-Wirkungsbeziehungen für die Adsorption an Aktivkohle und die Reaktion mit Ozon ermittelt und an den Pilotanlagen überprüft. Der spezifische Absorptionskoeffizient bei 254 nm (SAK254) ist eine geeignete Größe zur Steuerung und Überwachung der Spurenstoffentfernung und sowohl für die Ozonung als auch die Adsorption an Aktivkohle aussagekräftig. Eine Regelung der Ozonung mittels SAK254 wurde im Pilotmaßstab getestet. Die Pilotuntersuchungen wurden darüber hinaus durch ein toxikologisches Monitoring begleitet, bei dem unterschiedliche, etablierte Untersuchungsmethoden eingesetzt, aber keine Hinweise auf humantoxikologische bzw. ökotoxikologische Risiken aufgezeigt wurden, auch nicht durch Oxidationsprodukte der Ozonung. Um eine vollständige ökotoxikologische Bewertung zu ermöglichen, müssen die Methoden weiter entwickelt werden. Neben den verfahrenstechnischen Untersuchungen wurden für die Verfahrensvarianten auch eine Kostenschätzung und Ökobilanz erstellt. Sowohl die Gesamtkosten als auch die Umweltwirkungen einer weitergehenden Phosphorentfernung mit Flockungsfiltern erhöhen sich deutlich, wenn mittels Ozon oder Aktivkohle zusätzlich auch Spurenstoffe entfernt werden sollen.

The research project IST4R aimed at investigating different process combinations of activated carbon adsorption and ozonation with tertiary filtration for the removal of organic micro-pollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant effluents. Its main focus was the integration of OMP elimination into treatment options for phosphorus removal for future implementation in Berlin. The investigations were carried out both in laboratory and pilot-scale. The results demonstrate that both activated carbon adsorption and ozonation can be well combined with flocculation and subsequent rapid filtration. All investigated process combinations are capable of significantly eliminating OMP with a concomitant removal of suspended solids and total phosphorus. Additionally, both dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand are reduced. The elimination of OMP is specific for different substances and processes. The concentration of background organic matter has a strong influence on OMP removal for both activated carbon adsorption and ozonation. The UV light absorption at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV254) is a useful surrogate parameter to control and monitor OMP removal with substance specific correlations. Process control using UV254 was successfully tested in pilot-scale. A monitoring using established human- and eco-toxicological methods was conducted for the different process combinations but no indications for toxic effects towards aquatic organisms or humans were observed. Besides operational parameters, investment and operating costs as well as environmental impacts were estimated using life-cycle assessment (LCA). Both costs and environmental impacts of advanced wastewater treatment are significantly increased compared to conventional wastewater treatment.},

More than two years of monitoring for the bulk parameter DOC proved that the redox conditions significantly influence the DOC-degradation kinetic but not necessarily the residual concentration. LC-OCD measurements confirmed that the change in character is comparable for aerobic and anoxic/anaerobic infiltration. Only the fraction of polysaccharides shows a better removal under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, adsorbable organic iodine (AOI) measurements revealed a more efficient degradation of AOI and AOBr under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. The monitoring of the single organic pollutants Iopromide, Sulfamethoxazole and naphthalenedisulfonic acids showed that the redox conditions have an influence on the degradation behavior of some of the monitored compounds. Iopromide was efficiently removed at all times, but no evidence for a dehalogenation under oxic conditions was found. Sulfamethoxazole showed a better removal under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. The very stable 1.5naphthalenesulfonic acid was not removed under either redox conditions.},

   abstract = {The main objective of this study was to identify design and operational differences between the Danish and the German waterworks in order to learn if the groundwater treatment in the Danish and German water supplies is comparable. Furthermore, the aim is to compile existing national designs to create an overview of Danish and German designs, respectively. The work was carried out with an emphasis on iron, manganese, and ammonium removal, and thus the aeration and filtration method were evaluated. Design differences in groundwater treatment between 19 Danish waterworks, 9 waterworks from Berlin and 3 from Hamburg were compiled. The design differences were revealed by questionnaires, review of standards, and an expert interview. The most significant difference was the design of the filters. In Denmark most of the waterworks apply two-stage filtration, where both pre- and afterfilters consist of quartz. A total of 69 % of the Danish filters used in the project had a supporting layer. The average height of the Danish filters was 1.05 meter and 0.66 meter for prefilter and afterfilter, respectively. In Berlin and Hamburg the most applied filtration type was a single filtration through a mono-media (quartz) filter with an average filter height of 2 meters. Half of them (47%) were constructed with a supporting layer. In all filtration types identified in this study the average German filter height exceeded the average Danish. While the grain size distribution in the effective filter layer was found to be relatively alike and within the range of 1 to 3 mm, with a slightly larger grain size in the Danish filters. The grain size found in the Danish supporting layer was much larger than in the German supporting layers. Furthermore, a special design for prefilters, so-called roughing filters, was identified in Copenhagen waterworks, where the grain size distribution was between 24 and 150 mm. Despite the generally smaller grain size, the average filter velocity was found to be slightly larger in the German filters. The application of aerators and the backwashing procedure in Denmark and Germany were found be different. In Denmark the most frequently found aerators are the stairs aerator and the multiple slat tray aerator, whilst in Germany the most applied forms of aerators are spray aerators and waterfall aerators. The backwashing procedure in Denmark was mainly found (37 %) as a combination of first an air flush, and then water, whilst the most frequently found (50 %) backwashing procedure in Germany was a combination with an additional simultaneous air and water flush in between the separate air and water flushes. The more extensive backwashing procedure in the German filter is believed to be connected to the higher height of the filters. Empty-bed contact time was calculated, and was found to be significantly shorter in the Danish filters, where the average empty-bed contact time was 23 minutes, compared to an average of 38 minutes in the German filters. The water chemistry suggested that the groundwater types found in Denmark, Berlin and Hamburg are similar, but this was not investigated further. The conclusion was that the filters in Denmark are not comparable to the filters found in Berlin and Hamburg, based on the fundamental differences in the construction concerning the filter height, grain size, and numbers of filter steps and the resulting diverse EBCT. The difference in filter designs needs to be considered when applying future research to both supplies.},

This well ageing can be caused in carbonate aquifers by a chemical process : calcite precipitation. Using an hydrogeochemical model developped during the internship, the quantity of precipitated calcite and the time required to fill up the bore are estimated. It is then showed that carbonate precipitation is enhanced by chemical and physical parameters (hydrogenocarbonate concentrations, temperature) as well as the operating of the well (pumping and resting).},

   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions.
The present report deals with (ii), testing the biogeochemical model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) on the watershed of the Ic in Brittany, France, to evaluate scenarios for reduction of nitrate in the stream water. The model has been calibrated in several steps, each including additional information on the watershed. For the last calibration the hydrologic model predictions showed fair results with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.53 at the watershed outlet. The scenarios cover fertilizer reduction and the introduction of wetlands. Decrease of nitrogen input was applied on a) selected subbasins, b) on drained fields, c) all agricultural fields; wetlands were placed at three model subbasins. Three most effective measures according to scenario analysis were a) 50% fertilizer reduction in selected subbasins resulting in a 6.2% reduction of nitrate loads, b) wetlands draining 30% of the subbasin area with a 5.4% reduction of nitrate loads, c) 10% fertilizer reduction for all agricultural fields with 4.6% reduction of nitrate loads. The management goal for the watershed is the meeting of drinking water threshold at the watershed outlet. The analysis of observed data revealed that nitrate loads would have to be reduced by 17% on average to reach that goal. Consequently, none of the tested measures achieves a sufficient reduction.

   year = {2013},
   abstract = {Being one of the key nutrients, there is no doubt about the importance of phosphorus for all life on Earth. This element is even considered “life’s bottleneck”, as Isaac Asimov, one of the brilliant minds of the last century already stated in 1959 in his essay of the same title. Its importance as plant nutrient is emphasized by the huge amount of about one million metric tons of mineral phosphorus annually imported into Europe to sustain good harvests. Since phosphorus is a limited fossil element and given the strong dependency of Europe on phosphorus imports, its extensive recovery from “secondary deposits” is of paramount importance and follows the principles of the European Roadmap for Resource Efficiency. No matter, if there would be a phosphorus peak in the future or even physical scarcity, pure reason alone should force us to secure this vital resource not only for ourselves but also for future generations. Scarcity itself is not a problem of the future, but an actual thread to many people’s life whose cannot effort fertilizers to grow enough food for themselves. They know the essential or real demand of phosphorus humans need to survive, whereas in Europe we can afford luxury uptake. The availability of phosphorus is dramatically dependent on economical drivers. Looking at the current supply-chain efficiency of phosphorus, only about 20% of mined phosphate rock is finally consumed in form of food (Schröder et al. 2010). Most of the precious element is lost on its way from mine to fork. However, phosphorus does not disappear and can, unlike oil, be recycled once used. In developed countries with proper sanitation and wastewater treatment, the wastewater stream represents a relevant phosphorus reserve. In Germany, more than 50% of the annually imported mineral phosphorus destined to be used as fertilizer (about 120,000 metric tons) could be substituted by recovered phosphorus from the wastewater stream if it were recycled completely. Various technologies have been developed in recent years to tap into this secondary resource. They might also be applicable for other material flows like manure and digestate. The traditional application of sewage sludge in agriculture was the dominating recycling path in the past, but is increasingly refused due to concerns about pollutants being harmful for the environment and public health. Technological alternatives are about to contribute to close the phosphorus cycle again (Kabbe 2013). Although some of these techniques are already feasible, they still need to be implemented onto the market. Three waste material flows, sewage sludge, manure and digestate are all alternatives to industrial fertilizers and compete for the same limited land area. Thus, only solutions that safeguard human health and the environment are viable resulting in a driver for wide-spread application of innovative alternatives when direct valorization on arable land falls short. For successful market implementation, new technologies and their resulting products need to be proven capable and feasible. Within the European project P-REX, novel and available technical solutions for phosphorus recovery and recycling will be demonstrated in full-scale. Their performance and feasibility will be systematically assessed and validated, as well as the quality of obtained recycling products with focus on plant-availability and eco-toxicity. Environmental impacts (LCA) and costs (LCC) will be calculated based on these data. Together with the analysis of the legal framework and existing market barriers and market potentials for novel recycling technologies and their products, strategies and recommendations will be developed for efficient and wide-spread implementation of phosphorus recovery with regards to specific regional conditions. A first overview of legal, societal and market aspects has been elaborated within the first project year and was discussed in the stakeholder workshop “Recycled Phosphorus Fertilizer- Market Chances and Requirements” in Poděbrady (CZ) in September 2013. The finalized report (A. Nättorp et al, 2013) is available for download at the project’s website: www.p-rex.eu. Stakeholder workshops in different European regions will be organized in 2014 to ensure the involvement of all relevant stakeholder perspectives and regional conditions and needs. Especially the end-user perspectives (plant operators, fertilizer industry, crop farmers) need to be considered more in the overall discussion in the future. P-REX is aiming to increase the European phosphorus recycling rate from municipal wastewater by closing gaps between science, policy and practice, as it was a key message of the First European Sustainable Phosphorus Conference in March 2013: waste less, recycle more and cooperate smart (www.phosphorusplatform.eu). Besides wastewater and sewage sludge, manure and digestate bear substantial quantities of phosphorus for recovery and possible synergies just wait to be applied.},

In recent years various technical solutions have been developed to recover phosphorus providing mineral compounds suitable as raw material for fertiliser production or even as ready-to-use fertiliser. Regarding the implementation of these technologies, operational benefits for plant operators like the water utilities in the case of P recovery from wastewater and/or sewage sludge are the strongest argument for their market penetration. Without the provision of direct operational benefits, implementation needs to be motivated or even enforced by suitable and reliable policies. In order to realise a circular economy, it is important not just to focus on the recovery itself. The recovered materials need to match the requirements and needs of their intended users. Therefore, full value-chain solutions have to be promoted instead of isolated technology-focused approaches. Following our principles of sustainability and resource efficiency, the assessment of innovations must also include their environmental impact. This review provides an overview of recently developed and promising technologies for phosphorus recovery from wastewater and discusses aspects regarding their wide-spread application, along with their limitations. It will focus on recovery and recycling from sewage sludge. Not only the technologies themselves, also the recovered materials and their valorisation options are addressed. Results of the EU FP7 funded project P-REX entitled 'Sustainable sewage sludge management fostering phosphorus recovery and energy efficiency' and other recent initiatives will be included.

   abstract = {The aim of this thesis, carried out within the course of the EU-funded research Project POWERSTEP, is to investigate the applicability of duckweed in wastewater treatment in removing nitrogen based on the principle of the APS duckweed plant system. The motivation for this investigation is the intended combination of the Hydrotech drum filter with the APS duckweed plant system at case study one of the POWERSTEP project. The goal is to demonstrate and market a new wastewater treatment concept heading towards energy positive wastewater treatment plants. The investigations within the scope of the thesis were carried out on a laboratory scale to identify suitable duckweed species, the optimal duckweed mat density, relative growth rate (RGR), doubling time and the ammonium removal under the given conditions at the case study. From the four tested duckweed species Lemna Minor, Lemna Minuta, Landoltia Punctata and Spirodela Polyrhiza, the species Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata adapted best to the given wastewater composition. In a mix population of Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata a mat density of 0.075 g·cm-2 was determined to be best in suppressing competitive submerged algae growth and enabling duckweed relative growth rates of 0.072 d-1 and doubling times of 9.93 days. Based on the APS duckweed plant system, mean daily ammonium removal of 0.56 g N·m-2·d-1 and a daily ammonium degradation efficiency of 72.75% to a mean ammonium effluent of 12.26 mg·l-1 was shown at a lab-scale for a retention time of 24 hours. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that the principle of the APS duckweed plant system under the use of Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata can be applied to remove ammonium from wastewater achieving high reduction rates.},

   abstract = {Der Einfluss organischer Spurenstoffe (z.B. Arzneimittel, Hormone, Kosmetikprodukte und Pestizide) in Oberflächengewässer sorgt für eine starke Belastung der Gewässerqualität und deren Lebewesen. Ebenso werden Spurenstoffe in der Trinkwasseraufbereitung gefunden. Kläranlagen sind der Haupteintragspfad der organischen Spurenstoffe in die Oberflächengewässer. Die Elimination von Spurenstoffen kann durch Adsorption an Pulveraktivkohle (PAK) oder granulierter Aktivkohle (GAK) erfolgen. Das andere Verfahren ist die Ozonung, bei der Ozon (O3) mit der Organik reagiert und die Spurenstoffe eliminiert oder reduziert. Die Spurenstoffelimination kann online nicht gemessen werden. Weil sich die Spurenstoffe in der organischen Wassermatrix befinden, bedient man sich an Ersatzparametern (Surrogatparameter), welche diese messen. Ein bewährter Surrogatparameter ist der spektrale Absorptionskoeffizient bei 254nm (SAK254). Eine andere Onlineüberwachung ist die Messung der Fluoreszenz der organischen Wassermatrix. Es wurde gezeigt, dass es eine Korrelation zwischen UV und der Fluoreszenz in Bezug auf die Spurenstoffelimination gibt. In dieser Arbeit wird die Praxistauglichkeit der Fluoreszenzmessung untersucht und mit der bewährten UV-Messung verglichen. Die praktische Durchführung dieser Arbeit wurde an einer Ozon-Pilotanlage in der Kläranlage Schönerlinde durchgeführt. Für die SAK254-Messung werden I::SCAN- Sonden der Firma S::SCAN genutzt. Diese nutzen eine photometrische Einzelwellenlängenmessung bei 254nm. Die genutzte Fluoreszenzsonde ist die YSI-EXO2 der Firma Xylem. Sie misst die Fluoreszenz über einen fDOM-Sensor (fDOM = fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter). Die Extinktion dieser Sonde beträgt 365 ± 5 nm und die Emission erfolgt bei 480 ± 40 nm. Für den praktischen Vergleich zwischen SAK254 und fDOM dienen Onlinedaten die in einem Zeitraum von einem Jahr aufgenommen wurden. Die Onlinedaten wurden unter verschiedenen Randbedingungen, gleichbleibende Wasserqualität-variierender Ozoneintrag und variierende Wasserqualitätkonstanter Ozoneintrag, verglichen und ausgewertet. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Fluoreszenzsonde alle Werte unter den Randbedingungen analog zur SAK254-Sonde abbilden konnte. Die gebildete relative Abnahme delta fDOM war nahezu gleich des delta SAK254. Dies bestätigte die Korrelation von Fluoreszenz und UV auch im praktischen Betrieb. Zudem wurden die Auswirkungen des Foulings auf die Fluoreszenzsonde betrachtet. Fouling sind organische und mineralische Ablagerungen auf den Sensoroberflächen. Das Fouling wurde bei den SAK254-Sonden und der Fluoreszenzsonde festgestellt. Bei der SAK254-Sonde hat das Fouling Einfluss auf die Zu- und Ablaufwerte. Dadurch ändert sich die gebildete Abnahme und es kommt zu Überdosierungen. Auch bei der Fluoreszenzsonde sind Veränderungen der Zuund Ablaufdaten zu erkennen. Dennoch wird die gebildete Abnahme von fDOM durch das Fouling nicht beeinflusst und es kommt nicht zu Überdosierungen. In allen Abschnitten wurde die Elimination der Spurenstoff Benzotriazol, Diclofenac, Metoprolol und Iopromid gegenüber delta SAK254 und delta fDOM gestellt. In allen Auswertungspunkten war die Elimination über die Fluoreszenz tendenziell höher als die der UV-Messung. Weil die Spurenstoffabnahme mit der spezifischen Ozondosis (EDOC,korr) korreliert und diese konstant ist, kann die minimale höhere Elimination nur mit der „Unschärfe“ der Korrelation zwischen SAK254 und fDOM begründet werden. Anhand der Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit konnte die Korrelation zwischen Fluoreszenz und UV im praktischen Betrieb bestätigt werden. Die Fluoreszenz könnte als Monitoring-Parameter genutzt werden. Auch zur Regelung könnte die Fluoreszenz eine Alternative sein. Dennoch besteht dort noch Forschungsbedarf, weil der Surrogatparameter fDOM in diesem Forschungsprojekt nicht als Regelparameter eingesetzt wurde.},

   year = {2015},
   abstract = {The quality of prediction of deterioration models has been evaluated by applying the model GompitZ to the extensive inspection dataset of the city of Braunschweig, Germany. CCTV data have been evaluated with three classification methodologies (OctaVE, DWA and Substance) and for two dysfunctions types (structural and tightness). The most relevant covariates for model calibration are Material, Sewer Type and Diameter. These covariates drive the deterioration process and need to be included in the models. Modelling performance has been assessed by comparing simulation and inspection results. Results indicate that: (i) models are able to simulate quite accurately the condition distribution of the network with deviations smaller than 2%. Models have potential applications to support strategic rehabilitation / budget planning at the network level. (ii) Models are able to identify in priority sewers in poor condition. Models have potential applications to define inspection programs that aim at targeting sewers in poor condition. Inspection programs based on deterioration modelling are about 2-3 times more efficient than inspection programs based on random selection of sewers. (iii) Deterioration models are not able to simulate the exact condition class of all sewers. Only 20-40% of sewers inspected in poor condition 4 have been correctly predicted in condition 4. At both network and pipe levels, models with covariates perform better than simple age linear models. Models performance is similar with each classification (OctaVE, DWA, and Substance) and dysfunction (structural and tightness) indicating that models can be used successfully with each classification method. Two sensitivity analyses have been performed to assess the influence of input data on model performance. Results indicate that the performance of deterioration models is independent of the amount of CCTV data available to calibrate the model: - Good model performance is obtained by using less than 1000 inspections (40 km, 3% of the network for the Braunschweig case study) to calibrate the model. A wide amount of inspection data is not required to use successfully deterioration models. However, the condition distribution of these inspections is extremely relevant. Model performance decreases strongly when the condition distribution of the data used for model calibration differs from the condition distribution of the network.In other words, the condition distribution of the calibration dataset must be similar to the condition distribution of the entire network. This is also true for the representativeness of each covariate (similar percentage for each age period, material, diameter and depth). This can be achieved by performing random inspection on a small part of the network in order to get a reliable picture of the general condition of the system. Considering the results of this study, the effort and costs to inspect more than 1000 sewers is not justified, for the purpose of deterioration modelling, since model reliability will not increase further. These results are promising for the further development and use of deterioration models by sewer operators. Additional local studies are required to confirm these findings on networks of different sizes, conditions and characteristics.},

   abstract = {The adoption of decision support tools for the definition of cost-effective strategies is seen to gain more importance in the coming years. This development is due for one part to the general degradation of the existing systems and for the other part to changes into the regulations and demands for more transparency in decision-making (Ana and Bauwens, 2007). A key element of decision support systems is the ability to assess and predict the remaining life of the assets (Marlow et al., 2009). For this purpose, deterioration models have been developed to understand and describe the sewer aging based on available CCTV inspections and a list of factors that influence the deterioration. This report first describes the potential sewer deterioration factors and analyzes a panel of literature case studies regarding the relevance of each factor on sewer deterioration. Results are hardly directly comparable, because of the different construction practices, historical backgrounds and environmental conditions of the networks investigated. However, some trends regarding the most significant factors may be identified. In most studies, the construction year and the material seem to be the most relevant factor to explain sewer aging. Pipe size, depth, location and sewer function show generally a medium significance on sewer deterioration. Pipe slope was found to have a low significance for the structural deterioration, but a high relevance on the hydraulic deterioration. The effect of other factors as pipe shape, pipe length, soil type, sewer bedding, presence of trees, installation method, standard of workmanship, joint type, and ground water level have been highlighted but rarely or never investigated. On a second step, this report presents three main approaches for sewer deterioration modeling: deterministic, statistical and artificial intelligence based models. The models can be further categorized into pipe group and pipe level models (Ana and Bauwens, 2010). Pipe group models (e.g. Cohort survival or Markov) can be used to predict the condition of a group of sewers or cohorts and are useful to support strategic asset management, i.e. the definition of long term strategies and budget requirements. These models enable to evaluate the efficiency of several scenarios at the network scale. Pipe level models (e.g. regression, discriminant analysis, neural networks) can be used to simulate the condition of each single pipe. They may be useful to set priorities and justify asset management operations. Pipe level models are tools that can support the utilities in the short and mid-term planning and determine at a finer resolution how, when, and where to rehabilitate sewers. Literature results indicate that cohort survival and Markov models are two useful approaches for modeling the degradation of pipe groups. However, the quality of prediction of these models depends highly on the availability of a large amount of inspection data. Extensive datasets are required to create representative sewer groups (cohorts) with sufficient inspected sewers in each condition state. Regression and Discriminant Analysis were tested on several case studies but showed pretty low prediction performances. Three main reasons could be (i) the non-validity of model assumptions, (ii) the biased distribution of the datasets in terms of number of samples for each condition state and (iii) the lack of data for important deterioration factors. Neural networks have proven to be successful tools for the prediction of the deterioration of individual pipes. However, they require (i) relatively complex and time-consuming training processes and (ii) extensive datasets of CCTV inspection and deterioration factors. Only very few case studies intended to evaluate the quality of prediction of these deterioration models. Furthermore, validation results are often contradictory and hardly comparable since (i) the data available for model calibration differ (percentage of CCTV available, type of deterioration factors available) and (ii) the metrics of the methodologies used to assess the quality of prediction differ. Thus, there is still no clear conclusion about the best modeling approach depending on the modeling purpose (pipe group or pipe level). There is also no clear conclusion regarding the quality of prediction that can be reached since in most case studies only a few percentages of CCTV data were available and many data regarding potential deterioration factors were missing. Further research work is needed in order to (i) identify the most appropriate modeling approach depending on the modeling purpose, (ii) understand the influence of CCTV data availability on the modeling results, (iii) analyze the influence of input data uncertainty (CCTV and deterioration factors) on the modeling processes and (iv) find out the optimum input data requirement (availability of CCTV data and deterioration factors) for model calibration.},

   number = {Report D1.1},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {Recent infrastructure studies underline the general deterioration of sewer system and the risk reversing public health, environment and increasing costs (ASCE, 2009). Since the origin of sewer systems in the 19th century, sewers have been installed at different periods using available standards and technologies. Sewer assets have limited service life and it is crucial to assess their condition throughout their life cycles to avoid potential catastrophic failure and expensive emergency rehabilitation due to their deterioration (Hao et al., 2011). This report first presents the wide panel of inspection technologies available to obtain information about sewer defects and condition. Visual inspection (e.g. Closed-circuit television CCTV, zoom camera) appears to be the industry standard for sewer inspection. It provides visual data (images and/or videos) of the internal surface of the pipe. Defects are usually coded manually by the inspection staff according to standard coding methods. In Europe, the current codification system is the normative EN 13508-2 for visual inspection (EN 13508-2, 2011) used by the CEN-Members (European Committee for Standardization). In addition, physical techniques are available that can give further information and details about pipe defects. These techniques do not replace the CCTV inspection but can give deeper insights on the type and severity of defects. Sonar and Lasers enables to analyze pipe geometry and can identify defects such as deflections, cracks, sediments or corrosion. Ultrasonic testing and magnetic flux leakage (MFL) are applied directly on the pipe wall. They enable to measure wall thickness and detect pipe defects such as corrosion, deflections and cracks. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Infrared Thermography are used from above ground and are useful to locate pipes and identify bedding conditions, voids and leaks. Finally, network wide inspection technologies like smoke testing or Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) can locate cross-connections and/or sewer infiltration. The purpose, inspection procedure and limitations of these methodologies are briefly presented. On a second step, this report presents the available classification methodologies developed to interpret automatically visual CCTV inspection reports and evaluate sewer condition. These methodologies enable to transfer the extensive amount of visual inspection data from CCTV inspection into a more easily manageable number, useful to support asset management practices. Most approaches have a similar goal: they aim to rank rehabilitation priorities and support municipalities in the definition of rehabilitation programs. They do not pretend to replace the knowledge and analysis skills of a local expert but can help him to identify rehabilitation priorities. All methodologies provide an overall condition score for each sewer segment or sub-scores for different requirements (e.g. structural and operational condition) or dysfunctions. From the review of available methodologies, two main approaches can be distinguished: priority based and substance based methodologies. For priority based methodologies, the calculation of sewer condition grades is based on the most severe defects, the density of defects and/or the defects length. Condition grades express the priority of rehabilitation, i.e. the emergency of action regarding the probability of failure or collapse. For substance based methodologies, the final score is calculated based on the length of sewer that will be affected by rehabilitation actions. Substance based methodologies do not aim to assess the condition of sewers but rather to rank sewer pipes considering the amount and type of rehabilitation needs: replacement, renovation and repair. Each methodology aggregates and combines sewer defects in a very different way making very hazardous the benchmarking of final scores from different methods. Therefore, municipalities using different evaluation system are not able to benchmark the condition of theirs networks. Finally, the accuracy of the classification results remains a key issue, crucial for the further use of inspection data to support asset management strategies.},

Retention of CYN proved negligible under the investigated conditions. Degradation in virgin sediments showed the highest lag phases (20 days). Preconditioned sediments showed no lag phase. The presence of aquatic DOM yielded highest degradation rates (k1 ¼0.46 and 0.49 day1) without a lag phase. Readily available organic carbon sources were preferentially metabolized and hence induced a lag phase. Thus, the presence and composition of DOM in the water proved important for both CYN degradation rates in preconditioned sediments and for the lag phase. Cylindrospermopsin degradation took place solely in the sediment and not in the water body.},

Beside degradation, sorption is an important pathway for toxin elimination if these resources are used for drinking water production via sediment passage. However, to date studies that systematically investigated sorption of these toxins onto sediments are lacking. Therefore, the aim of our work was (i) to determine the adsorption coefficients of ATX and CYN according to the Freundlich and Langmuir model for sediments of various textures and (ii) to derive sorptionrelevant sediment characteristics. We determined sorption parameters in air-dried samples of eight differently textured sediments using batch experiments. Results for both toxins showed best fits with the Langmuir model. Organic C proved to be the main sediment parameter determining CYN sorption. There was no or little CYN sorption on sandy and silty sediments (0e39 mg kg-1), respectively, presumably due to charge repulsion from the negatively charged surfaces. Sorption of ATX (max. sorbent loading ranging from 47 to 656 mg kg-1) was much stronger than that of CYN (max. sorbent loading ranging from 0 to 361 mg kg-1) and predominantly controlled by clay and to a minor degree also by organic C and silt. While ATX sorption to most sediments occurred mainly through cation exchange this mechanism played only a minor role in CYN sorption to organic C. Hence, high mobility for CYN and moderate mobility for ATX during sediment passage has to be expected.},

This technological field is very recent and further interests - along with rapid and continuing improvements in performance (especially in terms of emission power) - are expected within the next years. After the physical characterisation of the few UV-LEDs - at 269 and 282 nm - that are currently available on the market, their disinfecting action was to be measured via biodosimetric tests. They show an increase of the inactivationwith an increasing fluence using different types of raw water, although some early static tests tend to highlight potential recontamination and inhomogeneous distribution of UV-light - which may be explained by the module configuration. Main other results indicate that UV-absorbing compounds in the various waters reduce the disinfection capacity. Morevoer, a more effective disinfection is observed at 269 nm than at 282 nm for a similar fluence. However, the emission output is better with 282 nm - UV-LEDs. Therefore, an interesting aspect, worth being investigated in the future is to ensure an optimized configuration, which balances the input power, which is necessay to run the UV-LED module, and its disinfecting action. With potential enhanced emission powers, new developments for UV-LED water purification applications would enable to perform larger-scale tests and shorten UV exposure times.},

Furthermore the durability of production wells may decrease considerably with the presence of oxygen and ferrous iron due to the precipitation of trivalent iron oxides and subsequent clogging. Field measurements are presented for oxygen at a bank filtration site in Berlin, Germany, along with simplified calculations of different oxygen pathways into the groundwater. For a twodimensional vertical cross-section, oxygen input has been calculated for six scenarios related to different water management strategies. Calculations were carried out in order to assess the amount of oxygen input due to (1) the infiltration of oxic lake water, (2) air entrapment as a result of water table oscillations, (3) diffusive oxygen flux from soil air and (4) infiltrating rainwater. The results show that air entrapment and infiltrating lake water during winter constitute by far the most important mechanism of oxygen input. Oxygen input by percolating rainwater and by diffusive delivery of oxygen in the gas phase is negligible. The results exemplify the importance of well management as a determining factor for water oscillations and redox conditions during artificial recharge.},

   abstract = {In Berlin, drinking water is exclusively abstracted from groundwater. For this reason, well monitoring is important to ensure a good water quality and a high well capacity. The project WellMa, which stands for well management, aims at the optimization of the operation and maintenance of drinking water abstraction wells. During the first work package of the preparatory project phase WellMa1, available data of 615 wells in Berlin were evaluated. Since ochre formations appear most frequently, the context between iron-related clogging and hydrochemistry, well construction and operation was examined. Based on the statistical analysis, TV camera inspections were identified to be the most reliable marker to indicate the iron-related clogging status of a well. The results were classified into four stages and set into relation to relevant chemical, operational and constructional parameters to determine trends and correlations. Outliers lie below or above the detected trends, as given by the generated boxplots. Seven parameters have to be taken into account: iron, manganese and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations, top of the first filter, distance to the next surface water, mean discharge rate and monthly operation hours. Wells, whose outlier parameter based on one of the following criteria, were excluded from further investigations: (i) clogging state 1, which should be lower according to the outlier parameter, at a high remaining specific capacity, (ii) nitrate-nitrogen values that should lead to higher clogging degrees lying slightly out of the range given by the boxplot, (iii) classification of the clogging degree shortly after construction, regeneration or H2O2 treatment and (iv) missing information about clogging state in the BWB well files and missing TV inspection videos to verify deviating values. The analysis demonstrates a complex interaction between the single parameters. High nutrient inflow because of river bank filtration, leakages of the casing, high discharge rates or unconfined conditions superimpose the distance to the surface of a deep screened well. Since the encrustations are mediated by bacteria, the composition and permeability of the biofilm varies depending on the engaged microorganism. Furthermore, the thickness and dimension are influenced by the available time for bacterial growth, the inflow velocity, number of switchings or position of the water levels.},

   title = {Preliminary Studies on P-removal by Adsorption from MBR filtrates},
   institution = {Technische Universität Berlin},
   year = {2002},
   abstract = {For advanced phosphorus (P) removal sorption processes were studied in benchscale to offer a post-treatment step in addition to the relatively unknown biological Premoval in membrane bioreactors (MBR) for decentralized wastewater treatment.  First three commercially available sorbents, granulated ferric hydroxide GFH, activated alumina ATE and an iron hydroxide/oxide FER, were screened for their affinity and capacity in removing phosphorus from MBR filtrates.  GFH features the highest loading and affinity for P and additionally removes organics followed by ATE. For example, in determination of isotherms at a P-equilibrium concentration of 0.5 mg/L the loading on GFH amounts to 20 mg/g, on ATE to 9 mg/g and on FER only to 3.8 mg/g. Very early FER was excluded from the trials due to its low capacity and desorption of bonding agents leading to an increase instead of a removal of dissolved organic carbon. Different influencing parameters were studied in the P-sorption on GFH and ATE. Lowering the pH from 8 to 5 improved the P-sorption only by 30 %. A pH-adjustment for optimization is not recommendable due to the strong buffering of MBR filtrates by the carbonate/hydrogen carbonate system. A decrease in temperature had no effect in P-sorption on GFH at low initial P-concentrations, while the loading on ATE was reduced compared to room temperature. Therefore, an improvement is not expected by an outdoor operation of sorption filters. No main influencing competition by other organic or inorganic compounds could be determined on P-sorption in MBR filtrates. Due to the negatively charged sorbent surfaces the specifically sorbing phosphorus has an decisive advantage over unspecifically sorbed anions like chloride and sulfate. In time depending experiments lacking of calcium had a kinetic effect on P-sorption, but calcium is present in sufficient amount for P-sorption in MBR filtrates. In sorption filter tests using bed volumes (BV) around 90 mL a limit value of 50 µg/L P is reached in the effluent at 8,000 bed volumes for GFH and 4,000 for ATE  sing a influent concentration of 0.3 mg/L P. At a lower influent concentration of 0.1 mg/L P the breakthrough at the limit can be extended to above 15,000 BV for GFH and 8,000 for ATE. While GFH affords a contact time of 10 min, around 30 min contact time is needed in sorption filters filled with ATE to achieve a late breakthrough. A partial regeneration and P-reloading on GFH and ATE can be achieved by using 0.6 M NaOH in differential recirculating flow reactors. But for several reasons the regeneration can not be transferred to sorption filters directly.  Due to the long operation time of sorption filters at low influent concentrations ≤ 0.3 mg/L P the regeneration and reloading could not be studied in sorption filters here. Therefore, the cost estimations could only be based on a few scenarios. Using ATE or GFH, total costs are in the range of 8 - 30 Cents/m³ depending on the possibility of regeneration and reuse of sorbents. If no regeneration can be achieved, an application of ATE would be favoured due to its lower price. Based on an effective regeneration a sorption technique using GFH would be preferable. This is emphasized by the high affinity of GFH for P, which is especially required at low effluent P-concentrations from MBR. As an outlook it is recommended to verify the sorption performance and to study the breakthrough behavior in a pilot scale (H = 1 m, d ≥ 300 mm). Furthermore, the investigations on regeneration have to be intensified and conducted in sorption filters to assess influencing parameters like the effect of the previous sorption time on regeneration, the regeneration time and concentration of regenerate. The frequency of regeneration and reuse of sorbent until disposal can only be stated by future longterm trials in sorption filters. Due to the low volume flow rate in the small studied sorption filter, which showed no pressure drop during the trials, it is hard to predict if a backwashing is necessary in larger scale. Whether the particle-free MBR filtrate is advantageous for filter operation, in a long-term scale microorganism growth might occur and result in clogging of sorption filters. In this view a regeneration seems to be advantageous and might replace both backwashing and disinfection rinsing.},

   abstract = {Hintergrund und Zielsetzung: Die Wasserwirtschaft stellt einen komplexen Handlungsraum dar, in dem zahlreiche Interessen und Nutzungen aufeinandertreffen, sich beeinflussen, gegeneinander abgewogen und koordiniert werden müssen. Akteure mit unterschiedlichen Beweggründen, Organisationsformen und Mandaten, die auch als Stakeholder1 bezeichnet werden, vertreten diese Interessen in der Interaktion und Auseinandersetzung mit anderen Interessengruppen. Die wasserwirtschaftliche Einheit des Koordinierungsraums Havel2, der das Land Berlin und weite Teile des Landes Brandenburg umfasst, ist mit Hinblick auf die Akteursstrukturen in der Wasserwirtschaft aus mehrerer Hinsicht interessant. Die wechselvolle Geschichte der Region hat zunächst zur Ausbildung zweier unabhängiger Strukturen geführt, die nach der Wiedervereinigung langsam beginnen, gemeinsam zu agieren und sich entsprechend abzustimmen. Mit der Hauptstadtregion Berlin sowie dem eher ländlich geprägten Brandenburg ist das Flusssystem der Havel einer Vielzahl verzahnter wasserwirtschaftlicher Nutzungsinteressen unterworfen.  Die im Jahr 2000 verabschiedete EG-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie (WRRL)3 führt ein umfassendes Flussgebietsmanagement als Ansatz für eine nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung und Planung in der Wasserwirtschaft ein. Unter diesem Flussgebietsansatz ist die integrative, sektorenübergreifende, auch über politische und administrative Grenzen hinausgehend e Bewirtschaftung von Flussgebieten zu verstehen. Artikel 14 der Richtlinie sieht als ein Instrument dieses Managementansatzes eine umfangreiche Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit an den jeweiligen Planungs- und Entscheidungsprozessen vor. Diese Beteiligung soll neben der Information und Anhörung auch die aktive Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit umfassen.  Ziel dieses Projektes war die Erfassung und Untersuchung der Strukturen der wasserwirtschaftlichen Akteure im Koordinierungsraum Havel und deren Interaktionen als Grundlage für eine Bewertung der derzeitigen Situation im Hinblick auf die zukünftige Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit gemäß den Anforderungen der WRRL. Einer umfangreichen und effizienten Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit wird bei der erfolgreichen Umsetzung der Wasserrahmenrichtlinie eine entscheidende Rolle beigemessen, da hierdurch Verbesserungen der Verfahren durch gesteigerte Effizienz und Transparenz erwartet werden. Eine zielorientierte Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit setzt eine detaillierte Kenntnis und Analyse der in dem jeweils betrachteten Einzugsgebiet vertreten Interessengruppen und Akteure sowie der derzeitigen Situation vorangegangenen Entwicklungen voraus. Die im Rahmen dieses Projektes erzielten Ergebnisse finden darüber hinaus Eingang in das von der Generaldirektion Forschung der Europäischen Kommission geförderte Forschungsprojekt HarmoniCOP4. Im Rahmen dieses internationalen Projektes, das von Projektpartnern aus neun Europäischen Ländern5 bearbeitet wird, werden zum einen die jeweils landesspezifischen Erfahrungen mit der Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit in der Wasserwirtschaft aufbereitet und neue auf dieser Grundlage entwickelte Strategien anhand von konkreten Fallstudien erprobt. Auf dieser Grundlage wird abschließend ein Handbuch zu Beteiligungsmethoden im Flussgebietsmanagement erstellt. Die auf diesem für das KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin durchgeführten Projekt beruhende Darstellung der Stakeholder-Strukturen in der Wasserwirtschaft im Raum Berlin- Brandenburg bildet neben einer Analyse des Rheineinzugsgebietes einen Teil der deutschen Länderstudie. Im weiteren Verlauf von HarmoniCOP werden die Ergebnisse auch in die für 2005 geplante Fallstudie6 zur Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit im Elbeeinzugsgebiet einfließen.},

   abstract = {In recent years several ways of recovering phosphorous from municipal wastewater have been developed. Depending on the applied technology the recovered products vary significantly concerning the concentrations of heavy metals and organic residues. Within the boundaries of data quality and present uncertainties a comparative risk assessment of seven secondary phosphorus fertilizers, sewage sludge, raw ash and triple super phosphate has been conducted for PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PAHs, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn. Local exposure assessment was done using the kinetic model of the European Union’s Technical Guidance Document for all substances accounting for both fertilization and average atmospheric deposition. For substances of concern (Cd and Zn) the exposure was additionally refined using a solute transport model (HYDRUS-1D) and a precipitation model (Visual MINTEQ-software). An annual fertilizer amount equivalent to 60 kg P2O5/ ha × year by these products is assumed. In order to account for potential accumulation a time span of 100 years is modelled. Results indicate that out of the selected 11 (groups of) chemicals only cadmium and zinc are of concern. Regarding soil organisms, zinc is of concern for sludge, raw ash and one of the seven secondary phosphate fertilizers in case of soil-pH above pH 6.0. Regarding groundwater, cadmium and zinc are of concern below pH 6.0 since mobilization at this pH level increase significantly. No risk is expected regarding the endpoint humans. Among the investigated products struvites have shown the lowest phosphorus-specific heavy metal contents. For ash related products more data from full scale operations are needed to reduce still existing uncertainties like the influence of raw wastewater quality and WWTP operation on the final product.},

Potential risks of water reuse for ecosystems or human health can be adequately managed if suitable processes for reclaimed water treatment are used and operated correctly. However, the study also shows the trade-offs between a higher level of reclaimed water treatment and increased environmental impacts from associated efforts in energy, chemicals and infrastructure.

Da bei der Rückgewinnung aus der Klärschlammasche hohe Rückgewinnungsraten, die den Vorgaben der Klärschlammverordnung genügen, erzielt werden können, ist ab dem Kalenderjahr 2029 mit etwa 30.000 bis 40.000 Tonnen Phosphor pro Jahr in Form von Phosphatrezyklaten zu rechnen.

   abstract = {The project Aquisafe assesses the potential of selected near-natural mitigation systems, such as constructed wetlands or infiltration zones, to reduce diffuse pollution from agricultural sources and consequently protect surface water resources. A particular aim is the attenuation of nutrients and pesticides. Based on the review of available information and preliminary tests within Aquisafe 1 (2007-2009), the second project phase Aquisafe 2 (2009-2012) is structured along the following main components: (i) Development and evaluation of GIS-based methods for the identification of diffuse pollution hotspots, as well as model-based tools for the simulation of nutrient reduction from mitigation zones (ii) Assessment of nutrient retention capacity of different types of mitigation zones in international case studies in the Ic watershed in France and the Upper White River watershed in the USA under natural conditions, such as variable flow. (iii) Identification of efficient mitigation zone designs for the retention of relevant pesticides in laboratory and technical scale experiments at UBA in Berlin. The present report provides a review of the properties and existing mitigation experience of the two herbicides Atrazine and Bentazone, which will be examined exemplarily in (iii). Whereas Atrazine is clearly the pesticide of greatest concern in the USA, Bentazone is mainly an issue in Europe with an increasing tendency. The sorption of Atrazine and Bentazone on soils is moderate. Moderate sorption in combination with medium to high persistency makes these compounds relatively mobile; therefore they can usually be observed in surface waters in general and in ground waters near places of their application. First experiences show that mitigation systems can be effective measures to decrease their concentrations by supporting biotic and abiotic dissipation processes, mainly at high residence times. Adding organic matter can improve adsorption of Atrazine and Bentazone, an important dissipation process in these systems. Degradation rates for Atrazine and for Bentazone can be increased by implementing highly microbiologically active conditions which can usually be accomplished in the presence of external carbon sources. While mineralization of both herbicides is favoured in aerobic -environments significant degradation of Atrazine was also observed under anaerobic conditions. A great number of open questions remain on how to design a mitigation system which is adequate to reduce herbicides in drainage water. For instance, there is no specific information on the degradation of diluted and adsorbed forms of the herbicides, very little information about necessary residence times, adsorption constants, half lives and leaching behaviour in specific substrates or comparable designs. Moreover, the influence of nitrogen, which is present in drainage water at high concentrations, on degradation of Atrazine and Bentazone remains uncertain. Finally, the behaviour of Atrazine and Bentazone (contained in agricultural drainage water) in mitigation systems in general and in bioretention swales in particular is poorly studied. Realistically, mitigation systems would only be implemented if they also allow significant reduction of nitrates. Given the existing knowledge, systems with both aerobic and anoxic zones are likely to bring most successful results regarding both herbicides and nitrates; though they may be difficult to implement. Both for nitrates and pesticides, the presence of external organic carbon sources (with a combination of fast accessible and sustainable substrate partitions) seems to be a good basis for dissipation processes and effective reduction.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2014},
   abstract = {The wash out of agricultural auxiliary chemicals like fertilizer and pesticides via surface run-off or subsurface leaching into drainage systems or ground waters, which discharge into surface waters, presents an increasing risk for drinking water production and biodiversity in rivers and lakes. Mitigation zones are important measures to attenuate contamination at the source and relieve surface waters downstream. Under high flow conditions, as they occur during rainy seasons and snow melt, the effectiveness of such facilities is restricted due to bypass of untreated waters or very short contact times. This study of the Aquisafe 2 project focus on drainage water decontamination and examines mitigation zone designs with organic substrates for their potential to reduce a set of herbicides and nitrate (NO3-), concurrently and efficiently, at short hydraulic residence times (0.2 to 2.5 days) to prepare their implementation in contamination hot spots. The herbicides bentazone, atrazine and isoproturon were classified as most relevant for drinking water production. On the basis of comprehensive literature studies the organic substrates bark mulch and straw and the design of bioretention swales emerged to be of high potential for decontamination of drainage waters in mitigation zones. In laboratory scale studies the substrates were tested in degradation-, sorption- and leaching-experiments at temperatures around 21 °C for their potential to ensure long- lasting hydraulic permeability, denitrification and attenuation of the selected herbicides. The selected organic substrates provide a high and long term stable permeable conductivity to realize and maintain high flow. The effective porosity yielded around 0.45 and reduced within 1.5 years by only 25 %. Straw is a readily available organic carbon source, which can support effective and efficient denitrification at short hydraulic residence times. Bark mulch contains more resistant carbon species, but contributes also to NO3- removal. In mixture with straw the performance of bark mulch as organic carbon source for denitrification increases (co-metabolic decomposition). Organic substrates are characterized by strong wash out of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and high denitrification rates (15 to 45 g-N m-3 d-1) in the start phase and successive decrease of denitrification performance due to loss of readily available organic carbon. Despite decline of performance, denitrification rates stabilized after one year of operation at constant conditions at a level of 4 to 10 g-N m-3 d-1 (10 to 25 % of input). The potential of the organic substrate to retain the selected herbicides is very different for each compound and bases on different dissipation paths. Denitrifying conditions are in general disadvantageous for retention of the selected herbicides. Bentazone is too persistent and mobile to be considerably retained under high flow conditions. Atrazine can be substantially removed from drainage waters. It is suspected to be attenuated predominantly by formation of bound residues at the organic substrate, especially bark mulch, and partially by degradation to hydroxy-atrazine. Isoproturon seems to be effectively retained under suboxic conditions by degradation to metabolites. At technical scale parallel retention of NO3- and atrazine and NO3- and isoproturon was investigated. The potential of the organic carbon source (mixture of bark mulch and
11straw) was tested under more realistic conditions at macro scale, under the influence of seasonally changing temperatures at short HRT (0.4 to 2.5 days).The high and stable hydraulic permeability of the substrates could be confirmed. At a bulk density that is half of the value which was observed at the laboratory scale, the effective porosity was double as high and still increased marginally over time (1.5 years). Denitrification correlates positively with temperature. At HRT of 0.4 days, denitrification rates between 8 g-N m-3 d-1 (17%) at 9°C (after 17 months) and 30 g-N m-3 d-1 (82%) at 21°C (after 12 months) could be observed. The substrate age (availability of organic carbon) had a high influence on denitrification. In 3 month old substrate denitrification rate was 21 g-N m-3 d-1 (44%) at 5°C. At HRT higher than 1.0 days denitrification was limited by NO3- input in the first year. The technical scale experiments reinforce assumptions from laboratory results about responsible retention processes of atrazine and isoproturon. At HRT of 0.4 days the formation of bound residues of atrazine correlates positively with temperature (10 mg- ATR m-3 d-1 (15%) at 9°C to 22 mg-ATR m-3 d-1 (52%) at 21°C). Substrate age seems to have low effect on atrazine retention during the experiment. At HRT higher than 1.0 days atrazine removal was limited by atrazine input in the first year. Isoproturon seems to be sustainably retained by microbial degradation under suboxic conditions. No significant degradation is assumed at anaerobic redox conditions. The isoproturon degraders need time to adapt and their performance can be positively correlated with temperature, under the premise suboxic conditions are established (11 mg-IPU m-3 d-1 (35%) at 5°C to 21 mg-IPU m-3 d-1 (75%) at 17°C at HRT of 0.5 days). The herbicides did not interfere with denitrification in the range of tested concentrations. Investigations regarding the effect of a dry phase on NO3- and atrazine retention show that denitrification can be improved for a short period, while atrazine attenuation is barely influenced. Instead, dry phases carry the risk of increased wash out of dissolved and particular organic carbon. The performance of the organic substrate is not stable. It decreases gradually since its effect is based on depletion of the organic carbon by degradation processes (NO3-, isoproturon) or linked to the presence of organic carbon as adsorber (atrazine). The organic substrate has to be frequently exchanged, while intervals depend on contaminant loads in the drainage water and temperature. In case NO3- is completely removed, the carbon source is used for competitive respiratory processes and the efficiency of the DOC usage for denitrification decreases (70% at HRT of 0.4 days and 35% at HRT of 2.5 days). In conclusion, the studied design presents a valuable and effective tool in the set of best management practices to reduce loads of nitrate and atrazine as well as isoproturon in drainage waters. System sizing needs to be adapted to conditions present at desired site.},

   abstract = {The present laboratory study tests the hypothesis that straw-bark mulch bioreactors are capable of concurrently retaining nitrate (NO3-) and the herbicides atrazine or bentazone at short hydraulic residence times (HRT). In a 1 year column experiment at HRT of ~4h three organic carbon sources, straw of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bark mulch of pine tree (Pinus sp.) and a mixture of both materials, showed high reduction of continuously dosed NO3- (100mgL-1) with average denitrification rates of 23.4g-Nd-1m-3, 8.4g-Nd-1m-3 and 20.5g-Nd-1m-3, respectively. Under denitrifying conditions, fast and substantial retention of continuously dosed atrazine (20μgL-1) was observed with estimated dissipation times (DT50) between 0.12 and 0.49 days in the straw-bark mulch bioreactor. In parallel batch experiments, it could be confirmed that atrazine retention is based on adsorption to bark mulch and on degradation processes supplied by the organic materials as continual sources of carbon. In contrast, bentazone was not significantly reduced under the experimental conditions. While aging of materials was clearly observed in a reduction of denitrification by 60-70% during the experiment, systems still worked very well until the end of the experiment. The results indicate that the combined use of straw and bark mulch could increase the efficiency of mitigation systems, which are installed to improve the quality of drainage water before its release to surface waters. Further, the addition of these materials has the potential of parallel retention of NO3- and less mobile herbicides like atrazine, even during high flow events, as expected at the outlet of agricultural drainage systems. High removal is expected for mitigation system designed to remain saturated most of the time, whereas bioreactors that run periodically dry are not covered by this study. However, further experiments with the tested materials at technical or field scale under more realistic climate conditions need to be carried out.},

Sowohl in den Plattenversuchen, als auch in den Versuchen mit den Biofilmen, haben Oxalsäure und die EDTA-Lösung die besten Ergebnisse erzielt, in bezug auf die sich lösenden Eiseninkrustierung und der nachfolgenden Reduzierung der Zellzahlen mit H2O2. Auch wenn diese Stoffe nicht in verockerten Trinkwasserbrunnen eingesetzt werden können, dienten sie doch dazu, die negative Wirkung des Eisenhydroxids bei der Biofilmbehandlung mit H2O2 zu verdeutlichen.},

   abstract = {At the Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) two membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plants have been operated since September 2001 by Veolia Water and Berliner Wasserbetriebe. The primary aim of the piloting is the investigation of biological phosphorus removal in conjunction with nitrification/denitrification in MBRs for later use in remote areas and small scale applications (WWTP serving a few thousand inhabitants) [Gnirss et al 2003a]. Both plants are fed with the same raw wastewater as it is treated in the conventional wastewater treatment plant. Instead of the mechanical treatment of the conventional plant, the raw wastewater passes a 1 mm punch hole screen prior to the biological treatment in the two MBR pilot plants. The two pilot plants are operated under parallel operating conditions (same raw wastewater, same sludge age and sludge concentration , etc.), but there are two different biological process configurations: pre-denitrification and postdenitrification without addition of a carbon source. Over the first year of operation, it has been observed that the unit with post-denitrification exhibited more rapid membrane fouling than the one with pre-denitrification. Preliminary LC-OCD (liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection) measurements carried out with the permeate compared to paper filtered sludge showed differences between the two units regarding the concentration of colloids and large macromolecules (as measured in the polysaccharide peak). Hence, an assessment and investigation of the fouling behaviour of the two MBR pilot plants was commenced. The results are presented in this report.},

This issue is particularly tricky in Berlin where the drinking water resources are very sensible to pollution due to the shortness of the water cycle. The Integrated Sewage Management Project aims at improving the management of the sewage network, in order to cut costs and to reduce discharges into the environment. The project relies on the modeling of the different parts of the sewage system (sewers, pumping stations, pressure pipes and wastewater treatment plants). This should enable us to have a global view of the system and to draft various regulation scenarios according to weather conditions. In the end, we should come up with a “policy” that could easily be implemented by operators of the Berliner Wasser Betriebe. This report summarize the main steps of the work that have been conducted on the subcatchment Berlin VIII, namely the building of the network in Infoworks, the calibration of the model during dry and rain weather.},

   abstract = {In the future, advanced phosphorus removal will be necessary in many WWTP in order to meet the demands of the European water framework directive. The project OXERAM deals with the comparison of different technologies with regard to their efficiency and applicability in tertiary treatment. In the course of the project membrane and microsieve filtration are tested in pilot scale at the Ruhleben STP. In this thesis the optimization of coagulation and flocculation prior to microsieve filtration for advanced phosphorus removal (< 80 μg/L TP; total phosphorus) was investigated. For the optimization of the coagulation/ flocculation several test series were conducted with the aid of jar test and the mircosieve pilot plant. A direct comparison of jar tests and the pilot plant showed that jar tests are an appropriate method to predict the approximate outcome of optimization steps (e.g. variation of chemical doses) in the pilot plant.  The pilot trials were able to demonstrate that the microsieve technology (10 μm pore size) in combination with chemical pre-treatment of 0.036 - 0.179 mmol/L coagulant (Fe or Al) and 2 mg/L cationic polymer could easily achieve good and reliable TP removal. The phosphorus removal was comparable to dual media filtration (< 80 μg/L TP) and partly even to membrane filtration (< 50 μg/L TP). The reduction of the residual coagulant contents in the filtrate was identified as the main challenge of this technology. High iron contents of about 1 mg/L were accompanied by floc formation behind the mircosieve in filtrate tank and pipe. In a microsieve the formed flocs have to endure high shear forces. Thus, the so-called post-flocculation was most probably caused by re-flocculation of floc fragments.  Very low phosphorus values < 50 μg/L were possible at high metal dosing. But the higher suspended solid load reduced the filtration capacity of the microsieve. Coagulation with polyalumium chloride (PACl) produced better effluent quality compared to FeCl3 as less suspended solids and less residual coagulant were found in the microsieve effluent. Furthermore, the transmission of UV radiation through the water was improved from 47 up to 66 % by using PACl which is favorable if a downstream UV disinfection is considered. When using FeCl3 the transmission was not improved or even reduced. Due to the influence on the performance of the microsieve cationic polymers were preferred to anionic polymers. However, the tested anionic polymer proved to be not applicable in the given process configuration due to very low filtrate flows. When cationic polymer was applied the polymer dose had a high impact on the particle removal and moreover on the contents of phosphorus and coagulant residuals in the effluent. In most cases 2 mg/L polymer was necessary.  In total, the microsieve technology in combination with chemical pre-treatment is a suitable option for advanced phosphorus removal. Through a dynamic adjustment of the chemical dosing to the influent water quality (e.g. ortho phosphate and turbidity online measurement) and the choice of polymer the process could be optimized in the future with regard to efficient chemical application. },

   abstract = {The pilot trials at the Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant proved that the microsieve technology combined with chemical pre-treatment achieves good and reliable phosphorus removal with effluent values < 80 µg/L TP. The first three months of pilot operation confirmed the general process performance observed during the pre-trials in 2009 but also revealed a need for process optimization with regard to the removal of suspended solids and the reduction of coagulant breakthrough. An improved performance was achieved through change from ferric chloride (FeCl3) to polyaluminum chloride (PACl). In the presented case, PACl gave clearly better results for the removal of phosphorus and suspended solids than FeCl3. Additionally, the occurrence of coagulant residues could be noticeably reduced. In contrast to FeCl3, dosing PACl led to an improvement of the water transmittance simplifying disinfection with UV irradiation. Load proportional dosing of PACl and polymer was introduced in order to avoid under as well as over dosing of the chemicals. The dose of cationic polymer had a significant impact on water quality and backwash time: With the initial process configuration 1.5 to 2 mg/L cationic polymer were recommended for a safe and stable operation with adequate backwash time resulting in an average polymer dose of 1.7 mg/L. However, latest results showed that a polymer dose of only 0.6 mg/L is possible without losses in water quality and filtration performance when mixing conditions were optimized. During the constructional modifications the hydraulic retention time of the coagulation was reduced from 4 to 1 min at peak flow. Due to the installation of a TurbomixTM short-circuiting could be avoided. Furthermore, the turbulence in the flocculation tank was increased. Despite the noticeable reduction of the hydraulic retention time and the polymer dose the rebuild resulted in improved reduction of suspended solids (2.2 mg/L) and coagulant residues in the microsieve effluent. The operation regime of the chemical treatment prior to the microsieve filtration showed to be a trade-off between the energy demand for mixing and the polymer consumption. Due to the continuous operation over more than 20 months important operational experience was gained with regard to backwash behavior and cleaning intervals. The backwash time mainly correlates with the influent flow (1030 m3/h), the influent water characteristics and the properties of the formed flocs. Due to progressing fouling of the filter panels chemical cleaning was necessary every 4 to 7 weeks. A shorter cleaning interval (e.g. every 4 weeks) might be beneficial as the backwash time and thus the energy demand could be kept on a lower level. In this application the microsieve produced on average 1.8 % of backwash water. The backwash water showed excellent settling properties (SVI << 50 mL/g) and might be easily treated via returning to the primary clarifiers. The UV disinfection plant behind the microsieve was operated with a fluence of 730 J/m2. Good disinfection could be provided for a continuous operation of 7 months. During this period there were always less than 100 MPN/100 mL of E. coli and Enterococci in the effluent of the UV disinfection. Overall, the microsieve in combination with dosing of coagulant and polymer is a robust technology with low phosphorus effluent values (< 80 µg/L) and a low energy demand of about 21 Wh/m3 (+ site-specific energy demand for water lifting). Microsieving, together with UV disinfection, can be an option for applications targeting phosphorus removal and disinfection, e.g. effluent polishing for sensitive areas or landscape irrigation.},

   abstract = {In order to meet the requirements of the European framework directive on water, authored by the European parliament, measures have to be taken to enhance the situation of the bodies of water in Berlin. The discharge of treated wastewater is an important source of phosphor into the bodies of water of Berlin. The OXERAM project investigates different possible technologies to decrease these entries of phosphor and the conditional growth of algae. Pilot plants for these technologies are being operated at Sewage Treatment Plant Ruhleben (STP Ruhleben). Installed are a microsieve plant and two membrane plants. In previous tests, it was possible to proof the functionality of the microsieve plant under static influent flow and volume proportional chemical dosing. Effluent concentrations of < 80 µg/L were reliably achieved. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the functionality of the pilot plant under dynamic operating conditions and load proportional chemical dosing. Therefore several tests were conducted. In a first step the pilot plant was operated with an artificial daily flow pattern, which was calculated regarding the daily flow variations in the influent of the STP Ruhleben. Tests under volume proportional dosing, and under load proportional chemical dosing, were conducted. The dosing of the coagulant was thereby varied according to the ortho phosphate concentration in the influent of the pilot. In a third step the influent flow was directly correlated to the influent flow of STP Ruhleben, in combination with load proportional dosing. During all conducted tests, sufficiently low total phosphorus concentrations in the effluent of the pilot plant could be achieved. By using load proportional dosing, savings of 11 % for the coagulant and 14 % for the polymer could be achieved. In addition several tests concerning the optimization of the whole process were conducted e.g. different reaction times for the flocculation and different polymer concentrations were tested. At the end an estimation of the operating costs for a microsieve plant of the size that would be required for the STP Ruhleben was made. Thereby the costs for Energy, Coagulant and Polymer and repair/ maintenance were discovered as main parts of the operating costs. The specific operating costs would be ca. 3.1 Cent/m³. To be able to compare the investigated technology with the other processes further tests of the pilot plant in combination with a UV plant as disinfection step of the effluent water from the microsieve have to be conducted.},

However, no study has compared the applied methods so far. This collaborative work presents a comparison between five different methods. A Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), EVOlutionary algorithm method (EVO) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) have been applied on various data sets (sewers, rivers, WWTPs under dry, wet and all weather conditions) and for three water quality parameters: TSS, COD total and dissolved. Two criteria (r2 and Root Mean Square Error RMSE) have been calculated - on calibration and verification data subsets - to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the applied methods. Values of criteria have then been statistically analysed for all and separated data sets. Non-consistent outcomes come through this study. According to the Kruskal-Wallis test and RMSEs, PLS and SVM seem to be the best methods. According to uncertainties in laboratory analysis and ranking of methods, LR and EVO appear more robust and sustainable for concentration estimations. Conclusions are mostly independent of water matrices, weather conditions or concentrations investigated.},

   abstract = {The ENREM project aims at demonstrating a novel wastewater treatment process based on the technology of membrane bioreactor (MBR), set up in a configuration to enable enhanced biological elimination of nutrients. A new plant, and the related sewer system, was built in a unsewered periurban area of Berlin. The plant is to be operated over more than one year, and the process to be optimised. Performances and costs of the treatment system will be then assessed for the size 250 – 10,000pe, corresponding to semi-central schemes. The plant was started on 28 February 2006 with 8 month delay on the program identified in the LIFE proposal. As a consequence, a project extension request of 8 months will be lodged, in order to match the initial duration of 18 months for the optimisation, evaluation and dissemination phase. This delay incidentally caused also a 6 month delay for the preparation of this Interim Report. Despite these aspects, the management of the project has been achieved according to the organisation identified in the LIFE proposal. Annex 7.1 presents and discusses the key deliverables and milestones depending on the LIFE proposal and the current status. In relation to the technical content, Task 2 “Site and process definition” and Task 4 “Detailed design” were completed early 2005. Task 3 “Preliminary testing on representative site” was completed in September 2005 and enabled to validate the design, operation and start-up criteria of the MBR demonstration plant. The public tenders for the construction of the sewer network and the MBR container unit occurred during the first semester of 2005, and the construction of the scheme was completed by end 2006. In parallel, the required legal permits were acquired (for plant construction & operation, water discharge), as well as the parcel hosting the treatment unit. A relationship with the inhabitants of Margaretenhöhe was maintained in order to ensure a smooth construction phase, and a quick connection to the new sewer system. The dissemination activities covered several communication vectors (Tri-lingual website www.kompetenz-wasser.de, press-release and articles and bi-lingual KWB Newsletter, local press, scientific press, plant visits and inauguration, communication material etc). The project results will be widely communicated in the national and international medien, and a final project workshop will be organised in June 2007. The main task in 2006 will be the operation, optimisation and technical / economical evaluation of the low sewer system and the MBR demonstration plant. So far, the budget is generally in line with the expectations, or slightly below. The project finances allow the project extension of 8 months, required to achieve all announced technical outcomes of the project. After the 8 month extension the final project budget is expected to remain about 20% below the planned proposal, i.e. approx. € 600,000 savings on the total budget should be recorded, corresponding to a subvention reduction of approx. € 100,000 (also close to 20% reduction).},

Thetrials showed that efficient Bio-P removal can be achieved with MBR systems, in both pre- and post-denitrification configurations. Bio-P dynamics could be clearly demonstrated through batch-tests, online measurements, profile analyses, P-spiking trials, and mass balances. High P-removalperformances were achieved even with high SRT of 26d (around 9mgP/L was removed withP/TS~2.6%). Under similar operation conditions of sludge age and mass organic load, the MBRsystem achieved slightly higher P-removal than the conventional technology. This was due to therejection of particles and colloids through the microfiltration membrane. When spiking with phosphate,high Bio-P removal of up to 35-40mg/L could be achieved without addition of external carbon source,and P/TS stabilised around 7.5%.},

The full potential of biological phosphorus removal could be demonstrated during phosphate spiking trials, where up to 1mg of phosphorus was biologically eliminated for 10mg BOD5 in the influent. The post-denitrification configuration enabled a very good elimination of nitrogen. Daily nitrate concentration as low as 1 mgN/L could be monitored in the effluent in some periods. The denitrification rates, greater than those expected for endogenous denitrification, could be accounted for by the use of the glycogene pool, internally stored by the denitrifying microorganisms in the anaerobic zone.},

   abstract = {Two configurations of membrane bioreactors were identified to achieve enhanced biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal, and assessed over more than two years with two parallel pilot plants of 2m³ each. Both configurations included an anaerobic zone a head of the biological reactor, and differed by the position of the anoxic zone: standard pre-denitrification, or postdenitrification without dosing of carbon source. Both configurations achieved improved phosphorus removal. The goal of 50mgP/L in the effluent could be consistently achieved with two types of municipal waste water, the second site requiring a low dose of ferric salt ferric salt < 3mgFe/L. The full potential of biological phosphorus removal could be demonstrated during phosphate spiking trials, where up to 1mg of  phosphorus was biologically eliminated for 10mg BOD5 in the influent. The postdenitrification configuration enabled a very good elimination of nitrogen. Daily nitrate concentration a slow as 1mg N/L could be monitored in the effluent in some periods. The denitrification rates, greater than those expected for endogenous denitrification, could be accounted for by the use of the glycogene pool, internally stored by the denitrifying microorganisms in the anaerobic zone. Pharmaceuticals residues and steroids were regularly monitored on the two parallel MBR pilot plants during the length of the trials, and compared with the performance of the  Berlin-Ruhleben WWTP. Although some compounds such as carbamazepine were persistent through all the systems, most of the compounds could be better removed by the MBR plants. The influence of temperature, sludge age and compound concentration could be shown, as well as the significance of biological mechanisms in the removal of trace organic compounds.},

A cost estimation analysis undertaken with few remaining unsewered and remote areas of Berlin showed that the implementation of semi-central sanitation scheme with a local membrane bioreactor plant would lead to similar costs than the connection to the central sewer, but with a superior effluent quality. For such small systems, some design issues have to be considered in order to optimise the costs and the operation regime, such as plant capacity increase, buffer capacity, process configuration and membrane flux.},

The application of RWHM techniques at household level seems to be mature, but sanitary risks exist when rainwater is used inside homes and also reserve on economical an environmental aspects can be drawn when drinking water supply is available. Promising concepts are being developed and demonstrated at larger scale such as industrial or commercial buildings or even urban catchments where the use of rainwater and the operation of the systems are under full control. For schemes of this scale, the integration and optimization of several beneficial aspects such as –traditionally- additional water supply and stormwater management, but also urban planning with water and green spaces, energy compensation in buildings and in the cities or ecological enhancement seems to be promising. Specific expertise will be required to best plan these schemes according to the local conditions and targets and to operate, maintain and upgrade them over their entire life time.},

   abstract = {This paper describes an innovative concept for treatment of municipal wastewater, targeting the improved exploitation of the energy content present in the organic matter of raw sewage. The concept is based on a maximum extraction of organic matter into the sludge via coagulation and micro-sieving (100 µm mesh size) to increase the energy recovery in anaerobic sludge digestion and decrease aeration demand for carbon mineralisation. Pilot trials with real wastewater yield a COD extraction of 70-80% of total COD into the sludge while dosing 15-20 mg/L Al and 5-7 mg/L polymer with stable operation of the microsieve and effluent limits below 2-3 mg/L total phosphorus. Anaerobic digestion of the sludge results in high biogas yields of 600 NL/kg organic dry matter input (oDMin) compared to 430 NL/kg oDMin for mixed sludge from a conventional activated sludge process. The overall energy balance of the new concept for a 100 000 pe treatment plant (including biofilter for post-treatment with full nitrification and denitrification with external carbon source) shows that the new concept is an energy-positive treatment process with comparable effluent quality than conventional processes, even when including energy demand for chemicals production. Estimated operating costs for electricity and chemicals are in the same range for conventional activated sludge processes and the new concept},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, membrane bioreactors have been increasingly implemented to purify municipal wastewater. However, even with submerged modules which offer the lowest costs, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology remains in most cases more expensive than conventional activated sludge processes. In addition, the European municipal MBR market is to date a duopoly of two non-European producers, despite many initiatives to develop local MBR filtration systems. The proposed AMEDEUS research project aims at tackling both issues of accelerating the development of competitive European MBR filtration technologies, as well as increasing acceptance of the MBR process through decreased capital and operation costs. The project targets the two market segments for MBR technology in Europe: the construction of small plants (semi-central, 50 to 2,000 population equivalent or p.e., standardized and autonomous), and the medium-size plants (central, up to 100.000 p.e.) for plant upgrade. Technological development of new MBR systems is fostered by a consortium composed of 12 partners (see Table below), of which five small and medium enterprises (SMEs) proposing novel concepts of low-cost and high-performance filtration systems. Two end-users, three non-profit research institutions and two universities, all of them well versed in research and development (R&D) in the MBR field, have been investigating for one year solutions to reduce operational costs such as fouling control, membrane cleaning optimisation and aeration decrease, or to optimise capital costs through improved implementation of membrane bioreactor process. Furthermore, an analysis of the potential for standardisation has been performed, and a technology transfer towards Southern, Central and Eastern Europe will be organised in order to facilitate the penetration of these new markets. AMEDEUS aims to achieve concrete and realistic technological breakthroughs for the MBR technology, and to improve the current process engineering and operation practices. It will participate to the competitiveness of the MBR European market and familiarise the municipal wastewater industry with this high-tech process.},

   year = {2008},
   abstract = {Two membrane bioreactor (MBR) plants were operated with a process which combines enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and post-denitrification without external carbon dosing in the anoxic zone. An enhanced post-denitrification with denitrification rates (DNR) twice as high as the expected endogenous rate was observed. Batch tests revealed a linear correlation between the anaerobic acetate loading and the postDNR which is remarkable since the aerobic phase was located in-between the anaerobic and anoxic phase. An anaerobic build up of a carbon storage compound which can outlast the aerobic phase is postulated. Measurements showed that neither polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) nor glycogen are used as carbon source for the enhanced post-denitrification. A carbon mass balance in the anaerobic phase strongly indicates the formation of a different so far unknown storage compound. This assumption is supported by literature data which show carbon recovery ratios of known storage compounds (PHAs and glycogen) in the anaerobic phase of EBPR systems often below 1 down to 0.3, in particular for trials performed with real wastewater. The potential of enhanced post-denitrification in conventional UCT systems is also demonstrated in full-scale non-MBR wastewater plants. When implemented in MBR process, enhanced nutrients elimination could be biologically achieved with 99% TP-removal and 90% TN-removal. A small full-scale unit is in operation in Berlin since March 2006 to demonstrate the process in real operation conditions with domestic wastewater.},

   abstract = {Urban water courses are considerably degraded in terms of their hydrology, riparian and channel morphology, substrate heterogeneity and habitat features as well as water and sediment quality. In addition, the combined sewer overflows and the ecotoxicological impacts of its components lead to a change of the physical-chemical and microbial mass balance affecting the biocenoses of higher trophic levels. Combined sewer overflows are therefore an additional stress to the ecological status of the urban course of the River Spree and of its channels, which is damaged already by both preload and background load of the aquatic environment. With regard to the assessment of the ecological water status, the European Water Framework Directives gives priority to the aquatic biocenoses in their capacity as ecological quality parameters. Against this background, an immission-oriented approach for the assessment of combined sewer overflows has to describe also their impacts on the biocenoses of the macrozoobenthos, the fish fauna, the macrophytes and the phytoplancton. Initially, the most important factors, mechanisms and processes determining the mass balance of a water course are described. Particular attention is given to the mass balance of eutrophic lowland streams and rivers and of river-lake–systems. In this context, the abiotic mass balance is discussed together with the biotic use of resources. After introducing the basic processes of the mass balance, the impacts of the anthropogenic use on these processes are subsequently described with regard to Berlin’s specific water resources environment. The result is a compilation of the hydraulic, physical-chemical and ecological parameters relevant to Berlin’s water resources serving for water quality assessment purposes. Starting from the ecological processes disturbed by the anthropogenic use, the potential effects of the combined sewer overflow are examined. The parameters selection is concentrated on the essential processes connected to combined sewer overflow issues. Based on the large number of stress factors and their interactive impact system, those influences of the combined sewer discharge are worked out which have to be categorised as particularly jeopardising and which are important target values for the future water quality simulation. Due to the high background load, the highest priority has to be given to the acute load caused by nutrients and carbon load peaks resulting from combined sewer discharges, since they overcharge the self-cleaning potential of the urban course of the River Spree and its channels. Even if the organic substances and the chemical contaminants discharged lead to chronic loads, the main objective is to avoid to the greatest possible extent the temporary but extremely hypoxic conditions, since combined sewer overflows cause fish die-offs when the water resources situation is already critical. Primarily, the water quality modelling has to be concentrated on the realistic mapping of the highly dissolved concentration charts of the target parameters oxygen and ammonia, since the degree of the biocenoses’ damage is rather determined through discharge duration, discharge intensity and frequency than through the medium rates of pollutant loads.},

These biocenoses are protected against the harmful impacts resulting from CSO only if the modification of their physical and chemical environment is avoided or reduced to an ecologically tolerable level respectively. In case that unfavourable impacts cannot be completely eliminated, the degree of impairment and the number of damaging CSO discharge events, which appear to be acceptable, should be defined. The present study is based on the bibliographic study „ Impact of urban use on the mass balance and the biocoenosis of lowland rivers under special consideration of combined sewer overflows” and deals with the assessment of CSO impacts on the ecological situation of the urban Spree and the channels (Cyprinid water bodies). In general, the immissionoriented assessment of CSO impact on the biocenoses (macrozoobenthos, fish fauna) requires the observation of the intensity, duration and frequency of occurrence of the individual events based on the assumption that, due to the background pollution, top priority is currently given to the acute CSO impacts. Requirements for the protection of aquatic biocenoses are developed with regard to the target parameters oxygen and ammonium/ammoniac and ecological tolerances of the biocenotic subjects of protection, which are strongest influenced by CSO. Initially, it is discussed to what extent the already existing results from laboratory investigations can be transferred to field situations. Next to the commonly accepted threshold values for oxygen concentrations during continuous persistent loads, particular requirements for the oxygen balance in case of peak loads are formulated.},

   abstract = {The herbicide Glyphosate was detected in River Havel (Berlin, Germany) in concentrations between 0.1 and 2 μg/L (single maximum outlier: 5 μg/L). As the river indirectly acts as drinking water source for the city's 3.4 Mio inhabitants potential risks for drinking water production needed to be assessed. For this reason laboratory (sorption and degradation studies) and technical scale investigations (bank filtration and slow sand filter experiments) were carried out. Batch adsorption experiments with Glyphosate yielded a low KF of 1.89 (1/n = 0.48) for concentrations between 0.1 and 100 mg/L. Degradation experiments at 8 °C with oxygen limitation resulted in a decrease of Glyphosate concentrations in the liquid phase probably due to slow adsorption (half life: 30 days).During technical scale slow sand filter (SSF) experiments Glyphosate attenuation was 70-80% for constant inlet concentrations of 0.7, 3.5 and 11.6 μg/L, respectively. Relevant retardation of Glyphosate breakthrough was observed despite the low adsorption potential of the sandy filter substrate and the relatively high flow velocity. The VisualCXTFit model was applied with data from typical Berlin bank filtration sites to extrapolate the results to a realistic field setting and yielded sufficient attenuation within a few days of travel time. Experiments on an SSF planted with Phragmites australis and an unplanted SSF with mainly vertical flow conditions to which Glyphosate was continuously dosed showed that in the planted SSF Glyphosate retardation exceeds 54% compared to 14% retardation in the unplanted SSF. The results show that saturated subsurface passage has the potential to efficiently attenuate glyphosate, favorably with aerobic conditions, long travel times and the presence of planted riparian boundary buffer strips.},

   institution = {VWT},
   year = {2018},
   abstract = {One aim of the EU-funded research Project POWERSTEP is to investigate the applicability of duckweed in wastewater treatment in removing nitrogen based on the principle of the APS duckweed plant system. The motivation for this investigation is the intended combination of the Hydrotech drum filter with the APS duckweed plant system at case study one of the POWERSTEP project. The goal is to demonstrate and market a new wastewater treatment concept heading towards energy positive wastewater treatment plants. The investigations were first carried out on a laboratory scale to identify suitable duckweed species, the optimal duckweed mat density, relative growth rate (RGR), doubling time and the ammonium removal under the given conditions at the case study. Subsequently, the results were used to test on a large scale on a sewage treatment plant. From the four tested duckweed species Lemna Minor, Lemna Minuta, Landoltia Punctata and Spirodela Polyrhiza, the species Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata adapted best to the given wastewater composition. In a mix population of Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata a mat density of 0.075 g· cm-2 was determined to be best in suppressing competitive submerged algae growth and enabling duckweed relative growth rates of 0.072 d-1 and doubling times of 9.93 days. Based on the APS duckweed plant system, mean daily ammonium removal of 0.56 g N· m-2d-1 and a daily ammonium degradation efficiency of 72.75% to a mean ammonium effluent of 12.26 m·l-1 was shown at a lab-scale for a retention time of 24 hours. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that the principle of the APS duckweed plant system under the use of Lemna Minor and Landoltia Punctata can be applied to remove ammonium from wastewater achieving high reduction rates. The experiment on the wastewater treatment plant shows that the effectiveness of the purification process is heavily dependent on climatic conditions. For example, in the summer the duckweed had a total nitrogen(TN) removal rate of 40-70%, while in winter it was only 17-40%. There were also great difficulties due to the occurrence of heavy storms. The plant switched off and was destroyed in many places which led to a dying of duckweed. There were also problems with the harvest of duckweed. Due to poor flow conditions, duckweed was not easy to clear off and could not be harvested.},

During a field study in India, the authors of this article experienced that well locks attract the attention of unauthorized persons and do not provide secure protection in unattended areas. To minimize the risk of losing data loggers, a cheap and simple solution has been invented to hide the instruments and associated attachments below the ground surface, inside observation wells. It relies on attaching the logger to a length of small-diameter pipe that is submerged at the bottom of the well, instead of attaching it to the top of the well. The small-diameter pipe with the logger is connected to a small bottle containing a magnet that floats on the water surface of the well and can be recovered using another bottle also with a magnet. A logger that is concealed in this way is difficult to detect and access without knowledge of the method and adequate removal tools. The system was tested and successfully applied for monitoring shallow
observation wells at three field sites in Greater Delhi, India.},

This is a typical scenario in many newly industrialising and developing countries, where new approaches for a responsible resources management have to be found. Bank filtration holds a great potential, thus being a low tech method and benefiting from the storage and contaminant attenuation capacity of the natural soil/rock. For this study, three field sites have been constructed to investigate bank filtration in different environments in and around the megacity with a main focus on inorganic contaminants. Hydraulic heads, temperature gradients and hydrochemistry of surface water and groundwater were analysed in three different seasons. Depending on sitespecific conditions, distinct hydrogeological conditions were observed and both positive and negative effects on water quality were identified. Most concerning issues are the impact of anthropogenic ammonia, the mixing with ambient saline groundwater and the mobilisation of arsenic during the reductive dissolution of manganese- and iron(hydr)oxides. Positive aspects are the dilution of contaminants during the mixing of waters from different sources, the sorption of arsenic, denitrification, and the precipitation of fluoride under favourable conditions.},

   abstract = {The main goal of this project is to develop new sustainable sanitation concepts which have significant advantages in relation to ecological as well as to economical aspects compared to the conventional systems (end-of-pipe-system). After successful project completion, the new sanitation concept should be used in Berlin areas, where sewer systems are not installed, as well as other locations (national and international). The management of the project has been achieved as foreseen. No relevant modifications have been necessary. In relation to the technical development all eight tasks have been started. Some later than scheduled but this does not endanger the goal and end date of the project. The first results from the greywater treatment with the constructed wetland show that the effluent quality is comparable to the wastewater treatment plants of Berlin In contrary to the proposal the new sanitation concept using vacuum separation toilets will be realised in the office building instead of apartment building. Furthermore not fifteen but ten flats are taken into account for the project and all bathrooms will be completely retrofitted instead of installation of new toilet systems only. Due to the fact that external assistance for designing is necessary the costs for external assistance is higher than planned. The precise figure will be available earliest at the end of 2004. All modifications do not endanger the goal of the project. For the information and discussion with the national and international public and colleagues about this project many presentations, publications and visits of the demonstration project have been undertaken and organised, respectively. The envisioned progress up to the interim report in March 2005 will be the realisation and start up of operation of the sanitation concept in the apartment building, exchange of the gravity separation toilets against vacuum separation toilets in the office building, designing, installation and operation of the digester. Furthermore all work from subcontractors (Life-Cycle-Assessment, Urine treatment, Fertiliser usage) will continue. Different international presentations are also foreseen. In relation to the financial issues 325.906 € (21 %) of the total eligible costs of 1.552.116 € and 511.515 € (23 %) of the total real costs of 2.223.474 €, respectively, have been spent until now. The 30 % threshold of the total real costs will be achieved presumably at the end of 2004. },

   abstract = {The ENREM project aims at demonstrating a novel wastewater treatment process based on the technology of membrane bioreactor (MBR), set up in a configuration to enable enhanced biological elimination of nutrients. A new plant, and the related sewer system, is to be built in a yet unsewered remote area of Berlin. The plant will be then operated over more than one year, and the process will be optimised. Performances and costs of the treatment system will be then assessed for the size 250 – 10,000pe, corresponding to semi-central schemes. The management of the project has been achieved according to the organisation identified in the LIFE proposal. No relevant modification has been required. Annex 3.1 presents and discusses the key deliverables and milestones depending on the LIFE proposal and the current status. In relation to the technical content, Task 2 “Site and process definition” and Task 4 “Detailed design” are quasi-completed, with however a four month delay which will put back consequently the following actions, such as start of sewer and plant construction, and plant commissioning. Specifically, the following actions were completed, or are on the verge of completion: - Cost-comparison of decentralised treatment solutions to serve 20 unsewered areas of Berlin and selection of demonstration site (district of Margaretenhöhe); - Revision of cost evaluation for infrastructure; - Planning and specification of MBR plant; - Preparation and release of call for tender of MBR plant; - Planning and specification of low-pressure sewer; - Preparation and release of call for tender of low-pressure sewer construction; - Acquisition of legal permits (for plant construction & operation, water discharge); - Acquisition of parcel for MBR plant. In addition, the first trials phase of Task 3 “Preliminary testing on representative site” (period with irregular excess sludge withdrawal) was completed and enabled to validate the design criteria of the MBR demonstration plant. The relationship with the inhabitants of Margaretenhöhe was initiated in order to ensure a smooth construction phase, and a quick connection to the new sewer system. Dissemination activities were undertaken accordingly as shown in Annexes 7.1-7.3, and the project web-site in three languages was set up (see in www.kompetenz-wasser.de). The communications on project are expected to ramp up in 2005 and 2006, as more outcomes and results are getting available. The main task in 2005 will be the construction and commissioning of the low sewer system and the MBR demonstration plant. The start-up of the novel treatment scheme is now expected for October / November 2005. From the budget perspective, the total costs incurred over 2004 were 198,353€. This is 6% of the total budget of the LIFE proposal. The infrastructure costs and most of equipment costs (expected 62% of total budget) should occur in 2005 during the construction and commissioning phases of the scheme. No major budget deviation was noticed so far, and the re-evaluation of the infrastructure costs fit with those of the LIFE proposal.},

   abstract = {Integrierte Produktpolitik ist ein sehr junges Gebiet, bei dem man kaum auf Erfahrungswerte zurückgreifen kann. Benötigt werden kreative Lösungsansätze, die sich auch unkonventioneller Mittel und Wege bedienen. Dies stellt höchste Anforderungen an die Lernbereitschaft aller Beteiligten. Dabei ist es wichtig, eingefahrene Gleise zu verlassen. Dazu zählt u.a., dass Investitionsentscheidungen nicht mehr von den Abschreibungszeiträumen der Geräte abhängen, sondern von der Funktions- und Einsatzfähigkeit und der Wartungsorganisation. Und genau an diesem Punkt setzt das Geschäftsmodell des ITZM an, unterstützt durch den rechtlich neu gesetzten Rahmen mit der grundlegenden neuen Philosophie- und Strategieausrichtung der Wiederverwendung („Used is Useful“) in der EG-Richtlinie über „Elektro- und Elektronik-Altgeräte“. Das ITZM besteht im Kern aus vier Säulen: der Gebrauchtmessgerätebörse, dem Testfeld für neue Messgeräte und –systeme, der Informationsplattform über das Internet und der Ingenieurberatung. Das ITZM führt die Anwender/Nutzer und Hersteller von Messgeräten und Messsystemen auf den Gebieten der Abwasserbehandlung, Wasserversorgung, Gewässerüberwachung, Produktionsüberwachung und Laboranalytik zusammen, um im Wege des Informationsaustausches umfassend ihre Kauf- und Verkaufswünsche erfüllt zu bekommen. Dazu bietet das ITZM über seine Internetplattform Informationen zu den Gerätschaften in Form von Testergebnissen, Literaturhinweisen, Anwendererfahrungen (Einrichtung eines Forums zum Informationsaustausch) sowie kompetente Ingenieurberatung an. Über das Testfeld werden Messgeräte/-systeme untersucht und erprobt, um die Leistungsversprechen der Hersteller unter realen Bedingungen zu ermitteln. Das ITZM bringt über die Messgerätebörse gebrauchte Geräte nach Überprüfung und evtl. Reparatur sowie Funktionsprüfung mit Qualitätsgarantie wieder in den Markt, realisiert Wartung und Kundendienst und sorgt für ein sehr gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis. Als neutrales und autark arbeitendes Unternehmen stellt die Beratung der potenziellen Nutzer einen wesentlichen Faktor dar. In Sinne dieser Machbarkeitsstudie konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass die Gründung eines Unternehmens ITZM auf soliden Füßen steht. Konservative Abschätzungen über Mittelbedarf (Geschäfts- und Investitionskosten) und den zu erwartenden Mittelzufluss aus den Geschäftszielen ergeben eine solide Geschäftsgrundlage. Das ITZM soll als eigenständige Rechtsperson am Standort Berlin gegründet werden. Dadurch wird der Standort Berlin gestärkt, der insbesondere als „Tor zum Osten“ ein neues, bedeutendes Instrument erhält. Denn nach Kenntnis der Verfasser dieser Machbarkeitsstudie existiert derzeit in Deutschland und Europa keine vergleichbare Einrichtung; ebenso ist keine Planung für eine solche bekannt. Mit dem ITZM werden Arbeitsplätze in Berlin gesichert und gleichzeitig auch neue, u.a. technologisch sehr anspruchsvolle geschaffen. Die Bevölkerung des Landes Berlin sowie eine Reihe umgebender Ortschaften, die von den Berliner Wasserbetrieben mit Trinkwasser versorgt oder deren Abwasser durch dieses Unternehmen entsorgt und gereinigt wird, sowie weitere Einrichtungen des Landes Berlin können bei Inanspruchnahme von Leistungen des ITZM direkt profitieren und damit Geld sparen. Das geschätzte Einsparvolumen allein für Berlin liegt bei konsequenter Umsetzung der vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen in der Größenordnung von mehreren hunderttausend Euro/Jahr. Bei der Einrichtung des ITZM wird auch eine geeignete Kooperation mit dem KompentenzZentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH (KWB) angestrebt, so dass auch das KWB auf dem Sektor der Messgeräte und Messsysteme auf eine Kompetenz zurückgreifen kann, die überregional und international von herausragender Bedeutung ist.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions.
The present report deals with (iii). It presents monitoring results on a constructed wetland, situated in the French community Iffendic, on the banks of the River Meu. The wetland was built by the local community, primarily as a flood control and nitrate retention measure. It is fed by drainage inflow from a small agricultural catchment of ~20 ha. It is constructed as a serial system of two vegetated infiltration ponds and infiltration ditches. Direct surface flow to the River Meu can occur at high water levels through an overflow from the second pond. The monitoring showed that inflows from drainage ditches in Brittany are likely one of the major sources of nutrients to the rivers of the region. As a result the constructed (though near-natural) wetland between a drainage ditch and the River Meu near Iffendic follows a very sensible approach. As planned in the design, subsurface flow paths were shown to flow through the wetland towards the River Meu. However, the share of infiltration turned out to be less than 1 % of the total water volume, because of low soil permeability and high flow events after rain storms. As a result the major share of the drainage inflow flows through the two basins before directly overflowing to the River Meu. Finally about 20 % of the water is retained in the system. Despite the suboptimal wetland hydrology, up to 41 % of nitrates and 16 % of phosphorus are retained in the wetland. These numbers are reached most probably by denitrification and plant uptake in the two basins. The retention could probably be further improved by (i) enlarging the basins, (ii) increasing the residence time in the drainage ditch (e.g., by installing small cascades) or (iii) by filling the drainage ditch with organic substrate, such as straw or bark mulch. Apart from the benefit in nutrient retention, the constructed wetland also shows a significantly increased plant bio-diversity compared to the former pasture. The reason for the higher plant diversity is the heterogenic habitat (ponds, hedges, etc.) and not oligotrophication, since the wetland is fed by agricultural drainage. The significant retention of agricultural pollutants, as well as the increased bio-diversity in the constructed wetland in Iffendic stress the potential of such mitigation systems.},

Heutzutage werden zunehmend die Betriebsparameter kontinuierlich ermittelt und durch Fernübertragungssysteme zu zentralen Datenbanken übertragen. Basierend auf einem solchen System hat die Firma Veolia in Frankreich ein Software-Modul entwickelt, welches die Messdaten der Wasserstände, der gepumpten Wassservolumen und der Schaltungen der Pumpen in einer Datenbank ausliest und Bilanztabellen und Diagramme in Excel erstellt. Dies bildet die so genannten „Bilans Lerne“, die es ermöglichen, die Entwicklung der Brunnen kontinuierlich zu überwachen. Die Anwendung dieses Instruments an den Brunnen der Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) wurde drei Monate lang beispielhaft an fünf Brunnen am Standort TegelHohenzollernkanal getestet. Ziel war es, zu prüfen, inwieweit sich die gegenseitigen Beeinflussungen zwischen den Brunnen und die für Berlin spezifischen Betriebspläne auf die Datenauswertung und Berechnungen des Moduls auswirken. Dazu sollte auch untersucht werden, ob das vorgegebene Messintervall, die Instabilitätskoeffizienten und die minimale Dauer für die Ermittlung der Betriebs- und Ruhewasserstände auf Berlin übertragen werden können oder ob Optimierungen notwendig sind. Dazu wurden zunächst einmal die gegenseitigen Beeinflussungen der Brunnen aufeinander geschätzt: Die Reichweiten der Absenkungstrichter erreichen mindestens 90 m und die betrachteten Brunnen sind ca. 50 m voneinander entfernt, so dass die Schaltungen eines Brunnens sich immer auf den Wasserstand in den unmittelbar benachbarten Brunnen auswirken. Dies ist auch auf den Gangliniendiagrammen der gemessenen Wasserstände deutlich zu sehen. In den dreimonatigen Messungen konnten die „Bilans Lerne“ für die fünf ausgewählten Berliner Brunnen erstellt werden. Allerdings sind die Ergebnisse der Modulanwendung teilweise unvollständig. Dies liegt vor allem daran, dass die Berliner Brunnen im Vergleich zu Brunnen in Frankreich sehr selten geschaltet werden, das Modul jedoch, um alle Parameter wie geplant ermitteln zu können, auf den Wechsel von Pump- und Auffüllungsphasen zurückgreift, um Fördermengen, Absenkungsbeträge und spezifische Ergiebigkeiten zu berechnen. So kann unter den Berliner Betriebsverhältnissen lediglich ein Wert der spezifischen Ergiebigkeit pro Monat berechnet werden, während für die französischen Brunnen i. d. R. ein Wert pro Tag berechnet wird. Da dies im Vergleich zum derzeitigen Stand der Praxis eine Verbesserung hinsichtlich der Häufigkeit der Ergiebigkeitsmessungen darstellt, kann die Benutzung eines solchen Instrumentes in Berlin empfohlen werden. Damit das Instrument in Berlin lückenlose Berechnungen durchführen kann, sind jedoch Anpassungen und Optimierungsschritte für die Makros erforderlich. Darüber hinaus könnte z. B. als eine Anpassung an die Betriebsbedingungen spezifisch für Berlin erwogen werden, die Messungen weniger häufig durchzuführen.},

   abstract = {Rain water runoff is the largest untreated source of potentially high loads of micro pollutants to urban surface waters. Given first findings it can be expected that new rainwater based micro pollutants will be included in future lists of priority substances of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Knowledge of the type and amount of micro pollutants is (therefore) pivotal for enabling good management. Pollutant concentrations depend heavily on rain event characteristics such as rain depth, mean rain rate, intensity, duration and dry-weather-period. As rainfall is usually reported to fall in events and is separated by rainless intervals of a certain duration, the minimum interevent time (MIT) plays a major role within the criteria for defining such rain events. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to the importance of rain event definitions in similar published works, which limits the significance of the results and their comparability to other researches. That is why this work aims to identify independent rain events from a pluviograph record with the help of further hydraulic data. It is also the goal to examine rainfall characteristics of (5) sub-catchments within in the larger catchment Berlin and their sensibility through the variation of rain event definitions, like the very important Minimum-Inter-event Time Definition (MITD). Several rain gauges close-by as well as sensors to measure the water level and the flow inside a storm water sewer of a separated sewage system supply the necessary data. Additionally a number of criteria, found in literature, help to identify the most stable definition of a rain event for these catchments. It is also the intention to set the basis for further analysis (within the project this thesis is realized in) in order to generate the most adequate concentration data of micro pollutants in Berlin’s urban rain water runoff, as this definition will play a major role for further project analysis. Moreover this work intents to emphasize the relevance of the selection and documentation of rain event criteria in studies that apply event-based data analysis.},

Because of a permanent clogging layer and the geological properties, travel times are slower at the BF site and the hydrochemical conditions are more reducing. First estimates for the reaction rate constants of oxygen and nitrate are obtained with exponential data fitting.

   abstract = {The redox conditions below an artificial recharge pond in Berlin were largely dependent on seasonal temperature changes of 0-24 °C in the infiltrate. Aerobic conditions prevailed in winter, when temperatures were low, while anaerobic conditions were reached below the pond when temperatures exceeded 14 °C. In contrast to temperature changes, cyclic changes between saturated or unsaturated conditions below the pond had only a minor effect on the redox conditions. However, the intrusion of gaseous oxygen during unsaturated conditions caused a temporary reinforced increase in oxidation of particulate organic matter. The effect of variable redox conditions on the behaviour of a number of pharmaceutically active compounds, namely carbamazepine, phenazone and several phenazone-type PhACs, was investigated. Phenazone is redox sensitive and was generally fully degraded before reaching the first groundwater well, as long as oxygen was present. When conditions turned anaerobic, phenazone was not fully eliminated. 1-Acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxymoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) and carbamazepine are very persistent drug residues. However, results suggest that AMDOPH may be slightly degradable under aerobic conditions too, but further studies will be needed to verify this statement.},

A powerful tool to characterise bank filtration systems is the use of wastewater indicators and additional environmental tracers to estimate flow velocities and proportions of bank filtrate in the abstraction wells prior to reactive transport evaluations. Examples  for tracer applications at the Berlin system are introduced in this paper.

The most important changes with regard to the redox state of the infiltrate occurred within the first metre of flow. Infiltration was mostly anoxic, as oxygen was rapidly consumed within the organic rich sediments. The infiltration zone revealed a vertical redox stratification with hydrochemical conditions becoming more reducing with depth rather than with distance from the lake. The redox zones were found to be very narrow below the lake and wider towards the production wells, suggesting that other than differing flow paths, reaeration after infiltration may also occur and possible mechanisms are presented.

Neon (Ne) concentrations were analysed at four different recharge sites in and near Berlin, where groundwater is recharged directly from surface water courses, either by near-natural bank filtration, induced bank filtration or engineered basin recharge. Neon concentrations in excess of saturation (DNe) were used to identify excess air in the infiltrates. Excess air concentrations were around saturation at the near-natural bank filtration site, where river water infiltrates through a permeable river bed into a confined aquifer under completely saturated conditions. At two induced unconfined bank filtration sites, samples generally contained excess air (up to 60% DNe). Highest excess air concentrations (up to 81% DNe) were encountered at the engineered basin recharge site. The degree of water table fluctuations, the water saturation of the sediments in the infiltration zone and the presence of a confining layer affect the formation of excess air. Excess air can only be used to trace bank filtrate or artificially recharged water in a setting where the ambient groundwater in the near vicinity of production wells is not affected by large water-table fluctuations. Nevertheless, excess air concentrations provide valuable additional information on the type of recharge (saturated or unsaturated, degree of water table fluctuations).},

   abstract = {Berlin relies on induced bank filtration from a broad-scale, lake-type surface water system. Because the surface water contains treated sewage, wastewater residues are present in surface water and groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers, including tritium and helium isotopes (3H, 3He, 4He), stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) and a number of persistent sewage indicators, such as chloride, boron and a selection of pharmaceutical residues (phenazone-type analgesics and their metabolites, carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium, Gdexcess), were used to estimate travel times from the surface water to individual production and observation wells at two sites. The study revealed a strong vertical age stratification throughout the upper aquifer, with travel times varying from a few months to several decades in greater depth. Whereas the shallow bank filtrate is characterized by the reflection of the time-variant tracer input concentrations and young 3H/3He ages, the deeper, older bank filtrate displays no tracer seasonality, 3H/3He ages of a few years to decades and strongly deviating concentrations of several pharmaceutical residues, reflecting concentrations of the source surface water over time. The phenazone-type pharmaceuticals persist in the aquatic environments for decades. Bank filtration in Berlin is only possible at the sandy lakeshores. In greater water depth, impermeable lacustrine sapropels inhibit infiltration. The young bank filtrate originates from the nearest shore, whereas the older bank filtrate infiltrates at more distant shores. This paper illustrates the importance of using multiple tracer methods, capable of resolving a broad range of residence times, to gain a comprehensive understanding of time-scales and infiltration characteristics in a bank filtration system. },

   abstract = {The T-He age dating method uses the ratio of the concentration of radioactive tritium (3H) derived from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing and its decay product Helium (3He) in the groundwater to determine a groundwater age, i.e. the time passed since the water had its last contact with the atmosphere. At the Free University of Berlin, hydraulic and hydrochemical processes accompanying bank-filtration are currently examined at two very different locations: In metropolitan Berlin and the rural Oderbruch polder region. The city of Berlin enhances bank-filtration through well galleries located adjacent to the surface water system. The spatial and temporal development of the bank filtrate is studied in cooperation with the Berlin Waterworks and the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water at several exemplary piezometer transects. The system generally behaves highly transient due to continuously changing pumping regimes. At the gallery Lake Wannsee, the well filter screens are pumping water from 3 different glacial sand layers separated by aquitards. The well water is a mixture of very old deeper groundwater, medium old water from the middle layer and very young bank-filtered water. The Oderbruch is located north-east of Berlin aside the river Oder. Intensive melioration activities in the past 250 years converted the former swamp into a fertile, agricultural region and lead to the permanent infiltration of river water into the shallow, confined aquifer. Compared to Berlin, the infiltration is a long-term, very stable process. The groundwater is getting older with increasing distance and travel-time from the river. The concentration of “stable” tritium (sum of 3H and tritiogenic 3He) increase from the river inland reflecting the decrease of 3He in the atmosphere from the early 60’s onwards. Peak concentrations are encountered in 2.1 km river distance whereas further inland (3.4 km river distance) old water which infiltrated prior to the nuclear bombing peak is encountered. In addition, the groundwater has a high radiogenic 4Heterr concentration which also indicates that the groundwater is more than a few decades old. Even further inland, in the central polder areas, the groundwater is unconfined and continuously recharged to some extend by percolating water infiltrating through shrinkage fissures in the overlying dried alluvial loam. The water is a mixture of young seepage water and very old bank filtrate, the resulting “mixed” T-He age is getting younger again. The T-He method was successfully applied to support estimated groundwater ages derived from tracer analysis (e.g. 2H, 18O, EDTA, Gd) at both locations. In the Oderbruch, the T-He ages were used to calibrate a flow model. The method also proved to be a very good indicator for the identification of mixing processes.},

Highest values for initial 3H (sum of 3H and its decay product tritiogenic helium, 3Hetri) were encountered in 2.6-km river distance. Concentrations of 4He in the water increased to 1.1 × 10-7 cm3 STP/g with distance from the river. The initial 3H data enabled an estimation of the longitudinal dispersivity with a simplified one-dimensional transport model. The best fit of modeled and measured initial H data was obtained using a dispersivity of 120 m. Deviations of modeled hydraulic ages and measured apparent 3H- 3He ages for older samples can be explained by dispersive mixing. },

   abstract = {A mixed surface and sub-surface flow riparian zone in Brittany (France), which is mainly fed by water from drainage ditches, was monitored for nitrate retention over three years from 2005 to 2007. Results show high time-averaged nitrate retention of >90 % for subsurface and ~70 % for surface passage. However, no retention could be detected during major rain events, which reduced the overall (flow-averaged) retention to ~40 %. Based on the findings, higher nitrate retention can be reached by increasing (i) the water residence time in buffer systems, (ii) the fraction of subsurface passage or (iii) denitrification rates in the system. (i) is only feasible if (active) buffer volume is enlarged, which may be difficult in practice. In the case of Brittany an enlargement can also be reached by extending buffer systems into existing drainage ditches. (ii) is of particular importance in areas with low soil permeability. In such areas, addition of gravel or sand beds can be considered. Regarding (iii), denitrification turns maximal under anaerobic conditions if sufficient carbon sources are available. In straw- and bark-filled column experiments we found high nitrate retention rates of >99 % and ~40 %, respectively, during a comparably low residence time of ~5 hours. As a result, the addition of external carbon sources to buffer systems is suggested. Currently, several pilot sites are constructed in the Ic watershed in Brittany attempting to take into account points (i) to (iii). For the following four buffer types, monitoring will start in February 2010: (a) two short drainage ditches, filled with carbon sources, (b) one drainage ditch and (c) one riparian wetland, each filled with a gravel filter, and optional upstream addition of carbon sources.},

   abstract = {The present study “Literature review on impact-based guidelines for stormwater treatment” provides an overview of international guidelines, which evaluate acute impacts of combined sewer overflows (CSO) on receiving surface water bodies. The overview should serve as a basis for the assessment of measured and simulated CSO impacts on Berlin surface waters within the projects “Monitor-1” and “SAM-CSO”, which are currently carried out at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water. In contrast to the classical approach of sewer emission thresholds, impact-based guidelines focus on possible effects of CSO in the receiving surface water. Impact-based guidelines aim at deriving locally adapted measures to minimize CSO impacts to surface waters. Thanks to this local approach, potential protection measures can be planned dependent on the state of a specific river, reservoir or lake. The following study focuses on acute CSOimpacts, which were identified as relevant for the biocenosis of the River Spree in Berlin within the KWB project ISM: (i) Increased levels of unionised ammonium (NH3) through ammonium input. (ii) Low levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the input of degradable organic components, which lead to DO consumption. Guidelines from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United Kingdom, France and USA are considered along with the approach by Lammersen, which assembles a number of scientific publications. The Austrian guideline (ÖWAV-RB 19) stops at distinguishing whether further investigations are necessary. In the US “CSO control policy” further analysis is delegated mostly to local institutions. The French “Arrêté du 22 juin 2007” also asks to take into consideration the local situation of the receiving water but does not give any limit values. The remaining four approaches provide a detailed evaluation scheme for critical NH3 and DO conditions, using duration-frequency-relationships. These relationships assume that pollution events of a specific duration may only occur in defined recurrence intervals (e.g. Figure 4.1). The Swiss guideline (STORM) is not suitable for dammed lowland river systems such as the Berlin River Spree, since it focuses on fast flowing rivers with salmonid fish populations. As a result there remain three approaches, which are interesting for the Berlin situation: the UPM guideline from the UK, the BWK-M7 guideline from Germany and the Lammersen-approach, which summarizes various scientific results. Apart from the dependency of critical concentrations on event duration and recurrence frequency, influence of temperature, pH and concurrent NH3-concentrations or DO-minima are considered by UPM and the Lammersen-approach. The relationships used by the three approaches for NH3 and DO are similar (see Figures 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4). Nevertheless, their comparability is limited, as the approaches generalize various local situations and cannot be derived strictly scientifically. As a first step we therefore recommend applying the three approaches to existing data from the River Spree and count the respective numbers of critical events. Based on the results it is possible to assess to which extent each approach is applicable for the situation in Berlin. As a second step experts need to evaluate the resulting critical events to distinguish suboptimal from lethal situations. For instance, the Lammersen-approach judges both (i) a two-day period with DO < 5 mg L-1 and (ii) a 30-minutes event with DO < 1.5 mg L-1 as critical. However in the Berlin River Spree (i) occurs basically continuously throughout the summer season and is tolerated by local fish species, whereas (ii) would probably lead to a major fish kill. As a consequence the prevention of (ii) should be given first priority. Based on the experience gained from the assessment of river monitoring data, simulation results can be evaluated in a third step. All the considered guidelines propose numerical simulation of sewer and receiving surface water systems. However only simple model approaches are discussed in detail, while specialized literature is suggested for complex cases. If numerical simulations are used for the planning of concrete measures, model uncertainties must be indicated to avoid feigning accuracy of results that cannot be provided. The Swiss STORM guideline suggests using Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate probabilities of the recurrence of critical events for possible management measures. We suggest a similar approach for the Berlin situation. Thus, decision makers could weigh cost against probability of success for proposed measures.},

In one case study on a constructed wetland in agriculturally dominated Western France, nitrate concentrations from drainage inflows to a small river decreased up to tenfold on the way through an intermediary constructed wetland. However, only ~30 % of the total N-load is retained in the wetland, whereas ~70 % enters the river directly during high flow events as a result of low soil permeability. The study underlines the importance of flow paths and infiltration for nitrate removal in natural or constructed wetlands, which is often neglected in practice.},

The upward diffusion of reduced substances originating from the decomposition of organic matter in the sediment was determined from pore-water profiles and related to the time of deposition. More than 80% of AHM was due to degradation of organic matter in the water column (including sediment surface) and diffusion of reduced substances from sediment layers younger than 10 yr. Sediments older than 10 yr, including the eutrophic past, accounted for , 15% of AHM. This ‘‘old’’ contribution corresponds to a 20–43% fraction of the total sediment-based AHM. The contribution from old sediment layers to AHM is expected to be even lower in lakes with deeper hypolimnia (. 12 m). In summary, oxygen consumption in stratified hypolimnia is controlled mainly by the present lake productivity. As a result, technical lake management measures, such as oxygenation, artificial mixing, or sediment dredging, cannot efficiently decrease the flux of
reduced substances from the sediment.},

The aim of the project is the development of a scheme for natural mitigation zones to protect surface waters from diffuse pollution in rural and semi-rural environments. In particular, key contaminants, applicable management and modelling tools and potential substance removal by constructed wetlands or riparian zones are being studied. Within these frameworks, two case studies are carried out in Brittany, the number one agricultural region in France. A hydrological model is currently being applied on the Ic catchment (92 km2) to test its capability of (i) understanding hydrological, basin-scale regimes, (ii) predicting the effect of mitigation measures and (iii) distinguishing diffusion pathways for different types of contaminants. In the second case study, a constructed wetland in Iffendic on the River Meu is monitored as an example of a natural and inexpensive mitigation option. On the way through the wetland nitrate concentrations from drainage inflows to the river decreased more than tenfold. In the ongoing monitoring, knowledge on hydrological flowpaths is improved to be able to quantify the retention potential of constructed wetlands in Brittany for nitrate and other agriculturally-based pollutants, such as pesticides.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2011},
   abstract = {Combined sewer overflows can lead to acute, critical conditions for aquatic organisms in receiving surface waters (Borchardt et al. 2007; FWR 1998; Harremoes et al. 1996; Krejci et al. 2004; Lammersen 1997). Based on the river type of the River Spree, CSO impacts of possible concern were identified to be high ammonia (NH3) and low dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) (Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung 2001; Leszinski et al. 2007). For DO, existing continuous measurements from the River Spree from 2000 to 2007 were assessed in detail in the KWB report by Riechel (2009). However, Riechel (2009) neglected NH3 toxicity assessment, since no continuous NH3 measurements were available. The present report aims at filling this gap by estimating the potential for toxic NH3 concentrations in the River Spree with recent data. Based on stormwater impact guidelines for ammonia, critical total ammonium concentrations ([NH4,tot] = [NH4+] + [NH3]) were calculated and compared to continuous NH4,tot measurements in the Berlin River Spree. NH4,tot was measured i) at a heavily CSO impacted river stretch (year 2011) and ii) at a monitoring station several kilometres downstream of the combined sewer area (years 2010 and 2011). The analysis led to the following results: (i) Two years of continuous NH4,tot measurements showed clear increases in NH4,tot due to CSO but no occurrence of critical toxicity levels for cyprinid fish, according to Lammersen (1997) (ii) Maximal observed concentration of ~1.3 mg-N-NH4,tot l-1 was ~5 times smaller than the lowest existing threshold, which would need to be exceeded for 24 h to be considered as critical. The observed maximal concentration peak had a duration of only 3 h. The threshold, corresponding to the 3 h-duration would be even ~8 times higher than the observed ~1.3 mg-N-NH4,tot l-1. (iii) Ammonia toxicity would only be possible if maximal NH4,tot occurred during highest sensitivity of the river due to very high pH > 9. However, it was observed that pH drops significantly during CSO impacts due to low pH in rain water, which makes pH > 9 during CSO very unlikely. Given the results, the risk for ammonia toxicity due to CSO is judged as very low, particularly in comparison with regular problematic DO conditions after CSO events in summer.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2012},
   abstract = {Combined sewer overflows (CSO) impair the quality of urban surface waters around the world. Future change, in particular global warming, is expected to worsen the situation further in many urban areas. To improve the quality of urban surface waters, tools are needed to support decision makers in the assessment of CSO-related impacts and possible mitigation measures. Apart from finding solutions to current problems, it is important that these tools also allow the adaptation of these solutions to future change scenarios to be prepared for likely developments. The present report suggests a model-based planning instrument for the assessment of CSO impacts on receiving surface waters under different sewer management and climate change scenarios. The suggested planning instrument couples a sewer and a surface water model for which boundary conditions can be changed depending on the studied scenario. The simulated CSO impact is then analysed via a coupled impact-assessment tool. The selection of appropriate model approach, assessment guideline and scenarios depend on the local conditions regarding the sewer system, the surface water type and the relevant CSO impact. Accordingly, the report aims at giving a general overview of available models, assessment guidelines, as well as sewer management and change scenarios, which allows setting up a planning instrument for a wide range of local conditions. The present report serves as a step-by-step-manual for setting up an impactbased planning instrument for CSO control: 1. Assessment of possible impacts of CSO, depending on local receiving surface water bodies (chapter 2.1) 2. If this assessment shows the need for a planning instrument, sewer and surface water models should be selected depending on type of impact, type of sewer system and type of surface water body (chapters 2.2 and 2.3). 3. Selected models need to be run, validated and possibly calibrated separately and as coupled tools (chapter 2.4).4. Scenarios are defined consisting of (i) CSO management solutions, depending on impacts of CSO that should be mitigated and sewer system characteristics (chapter 3.2) and (ii) global or local change to be accounted for depending on the local situation (chapter 3.1). The instrument can be used to test sensitivity of CSO impacts to different scenarios or for concrete planning of measures, including cost (chapters 3.3 and 3.4). Use of the manual is exemplified in a case study for Berlin for each of the above steps. Application of the Berlin planning instrument will be demonstrated in Prepared Report D 1.3.2, due in February 2013.},

Ende 2016 wurde die "KURAS-Methode" als Ausgangspunkt für die zukünftige dezentrale Regenwasserbewirtschaftung in der Koalitionsvereinbarung der neuen Regierung des Landes Berlin zur Umsetzung in die Praxis und zur Weiterentwicklung festgeschrieben. Dadurch werden aktuell in verschiedenen Neubau- und Sanierungsvorhaben in Berlin Elemente der Methode eingesetzt; insbesondere der Ansatz, dass die Maßnahmenauswahl erst nach einer Festlegung nicht-monetärer Ziele erfolgt, wird dabei berücksichtigt. Die Anwendung in der Praxis erfordert aber auch eine Vereinfachung (z. B. Reduktion der Ziele) und Weiterentwicklung der Methode. Diese Anpassung wird durch das Forschungsprojekt netWORKS 4 unterstützt, welches wichtige sozio-kulturelle Ziele berücksichtigt und konkrete Planungsworkshops in Berlin begleitet.},

Die Versuche der spektralen Untersuchung zeigten im niedrigeren Wellenlängenbereich um 254 nm ein stärkerer Zuwachs, als bei höheren Wellenlängen um 360 nm nm zu verzeichnen war. Dieser Umstand führt zu einer unzureichenden Trübungskompensation sowie einem Anstieg des gemessenen SAK254. Zur Lösung dieser Problematik wurde ein sondeninterner Abgleich der Spektren durchgeführt, um so die Trübungskompensation mittels Integration eines Korrekturfaktors zu optimieren. Zur Identifizierung von Fouling anhand eines E-delta SAK-Diagramms oder zur Optimierung der Trübungskompensation per Korrekturfaktor, sind jedoch weitere Versuche notwendig.},

After detecting a number of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater samples from a bank filtration site in Berlin, Germany, the research on these compounds has focused on investigating their transport behavior during the infiltration process. In the studies presented in this paper, the fate of six pharmaceutical residues detected at concentrations up to the µg/L-level in Berlin’s surface waters was investigated. During bank filtration, the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone, the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone and the drug metabolites clofibric acid and 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) were found to leach from the surface water into the groundwater aquifers. They also occur at low ng/Lconcentrations in the receiving water-supply wells. Other compounds namely the antiphlogistic drug indometacine and the blood regulating drug bezafibrate which are also detected at concentrations up 100 ng/L in the surface water are efficiently removed by bank filtration. Thus, they have not been detected downstream of the first two monitoring wells. In conclusion, bank filtration was found to decrease the concentrations of some drug residues (e.g. of diclofenac, carbamazepine) or even to remove selected compounds (e.g. bezafibrate, indometacine). However, a complete removal of all potential pharmaceutical residues by bank filtration cannot be guaranteed.},

We also included one potentially invasive (Aphanizomenon ovalisporum) Nostocales species. We conducted semi-continuous culture experiments and a microcosm experiment along a natural light gradient. Temperature data were used to design a model to simulate the development of selected species according to three temperature scenarios (past, present and future). Native species had significantly higher growth rates than invasive species and the potential invader A. ovalisporum at low temperatures (<= 10 °C), while the opposite was true at high temperatures (>= 35 °C). Maximum growth rates of A. ovalisporum, A. aphanizomenoides and C. raciborskii were clearly higher than those of A. bergii and the native species. Regarding light-dependent growth, significant differences were found between single species but not between all native and invasive species. The model simulation demonstrates a shift in dominance from the native A. gracile in the historic scenario to C. raciborskii populations in the future scenario, in which also the potential invader A. ovalisporum is able to establish populations in temperate lakes. Our findings suggest that any further temperature increase would promote the growth and development of Nostocales species in general, and that of the invasive species in particular, and would enable a more northward expansion of A. ovalisporum.},

   year = {2020},
   abstract = {Appropriate collection and disposal of medicine-related waste has been identified as one of the main ways to decrease the emission of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment. Improvement to the take-back and treatment of collected pharmaceutical waste may be considered lowhanging fruit when one is considering measures to reduce API emissions. However, comparable information that would enable estimating the potential impact of these efforts has not been available. Directive 2004/27/EC, related to medicinal products for human use, mandates that EU member states implement appropriate collection schemes for unused or expired human-use medicinal products. However, it does not provide any guidelines on practical implementation of these schemes. Several studies have pointed out significant differences among Member States in this regard. In March 2019, the European Commission published the European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment. The actions specified therein cover all stages of the pharmaceutical life cycle, from design and production to disposal and waste management. It emphasizes such elements as sharing good practices, co-operating at international level, and improving understanding of the risks. This report is aimed at filling knowledge gaps and proposing good practices for take-back and disposal of unused human and veterinary medicines and other pharmaceutical waste. The report is targeted to e.g. ministries, environment and medicines agencies, supervisory authorities, municipalities, hospitals, NGOs, pharmacists, doctors, and veterinarians. For the report, current national practices for take-back and disposal of unused medicines and other pharmaceutical waste in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden were evaluated. The pharmaceutical waste originating from households, hospitals and other health care institutions, the pharmaceutical industry, and veterinary use was considered. The proportion of citizens who return unused pharmaceuticals via designated collection points varies greatly between Baltic Sea countries, from about 10% to 70%, with 16–80% disposing of them of as mixed household waste and 3–30% flushing them down the drain. The most commonly cited reason for improper disposal of medicines on households’ part is lack of information about their environmental impacts and how to get rid of them in an environmentally sound manner. Separate collection of unused household pharmaceuticals does not exist in Russia, and the collection mechanism functions poorly in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Information on the take-back schemes for unused human medicines is more readily available than is corresponding information on veterinary medicines. We identified, all told, 21 good practices and recommendations for take-back and disposal of unused pharmaceuticals and other pharmaceutical waste and for promoting the rational use of pharmaceuticals in the Baltic Sea region. Nevertheless, implementing them at national level requires particular consideration due to differences in national legislation and other characteristics of the EU Baltic Sea countries and Russia. The good practices identified in this report answer the call issued in the EU strategic approach for an efficient risk-reduction strategy.},

   school = {Fachbereich Geowissenschaften},
   type = {PhD Thesis},
   year = {2016},
   abstract = {Redox condition, in particular the amount of oxygen in groundwater used for drinking water supply, is a key factor for the drinking water quality as well as for the production well’s lifecycle. Thus, a process-based and quantitative understanding about the oxygen fluxes in groundwater systems is fundamental in order to predict e.g. the removal capacity of pollutants or in particular the likelihood of iron-related well clogging. Such well ageing is a major thread for well operators and objective in practice and science. The formation of iron oxides responsible for well clogging is mainly known for wells abstracting groundwater from unconsolidated aquifers with a distinct redox zonation. The accumulation of precipitates is primarily taking place at the slots of the well screens, but also affects aquifers, pumps and collector pipes. Several studies already identified interacting hydro-chemical and microbiological processes as major cause for the development of iron oxides in wells. They develop in the presence of dissolved species of iron and oxygen in the water. The co-occurrence of both, the dissolved iron and oxygen, is the result of a mixing of groundwater with different redox states. The abstraction of groundwater by wells is known to promote such mixing processes. Particularly, frequent water table oscillations with high amplitudes in contrast to natural conditions and managed aquifer recharge measures may deliver oxygen to groundwater. But the impact of different well management strategies on the sources and rates of oxygen delivery to aquifers was not studied in detail so far. Within the thesis presented here, oxygen fluxes to groundwater were qualified and quantified based on statistical, modelling, laboratory and field site studies and their impact on well performance was determined for different well operation schemes and different hydrogeological conditions. Processes were exemplarily investigated for the quaternary aquifers of Berlin, which are the exclusive source for the drinking water supply of the German capital. Analysis of design, operation, geological setting, hydrochemical composition and maintenance activities of Berlin’s drinking water wells illustrated the vulnerability of wells for clogging processes and revealed the relevance of detailed investigations on this topic. A general estimation of the two main oxygen delivering processes influencing groundwater aeration, air entrapment and bank filtration, was done by a generic transport model. Simulation of oxygen fluxes with regard to different hydrogeological and operational boundary conditions revealed air entrapment as major source. Oxygen delivery by bank filtration was subsidiary and strongly depending on flow gradients and permeability of the banks. Air entrapment due to oscillating water tables was quantified by aeration tests in column experiments under laboratory conditions. Results pointed at a downward shift of oxygen caused by repeated oscillations as a consequence of oxygen dissolution and advective transport of dissolved oxygen inside the column. A downward propagation of oxygen into the permanently water-saturated zone was not observed for switching intervals shorter than 24 hours. Such repeated short-termed oscillations led to an enrichment of oxygen, but with a constantly decreasing increment per oscillation. Oxygen degradation was not accounted for in simulation and inhibited in laboratory studies. But, in situ monitoring of oxygen at three selected well sites in Berlin provided a real insight into oxygen fluxes and their effects on well ageing processes under field conditions. The monitoring network included multi-level observation wells and vertical strings of oxygen sensors installed in the aquifer and inside the wells. Thus, it was feasible to measure changes in hydraulic conditions and redox dynamics. Oxygen distribution could be observed as a function of depth and recharge source in a high temporal and spatial resolution for the first time. It was possible to detect traces of oxygen in the well-near aquifer and inside the wells, which are sufficient to oxidize high loads of dissolved iron when supplied constantly. All three well sites showed oxygen distribution patterns, which significantly differed from the others. These variations referred not only to the initial distribution, sampled at idle equilibrium, but also to the progression of oxygen saturation during abstraction and recovery phases. Enrichment and downward propagation of oxygen as result of abstracting water could be observed at all well sites, although absolute concentrations varied strongly between the well sites. By this, it was possible to correlate oxygen variations to hydrogeological boundary conditions. Infiltrating oxic surface water via river, lake or artificial pond banks delivers high amounts of oxygen to the groundwater and can cause an enormous widening of the oxic zone towards the abstracting well. As a result, the oxic/anoxic interface moves downward close to the well once water is abstracted. But, clogging of wells abstracting bank filtrate or artificial recharge strongly depends on the residence times of the filtrate, the hydraulic connection between banks and groundwater and seasonal variations. Only under certain conditions a significant enhancement of clogging can be expected. To directly link well operation, oxygen delivery and ochre formation with well performance development, a well model scaled up to realistic proportions was designed, built and operated with natural groundwater. The tank experiment enabled to study distribution patterns of ochre formation with regard to the different structural zones of the well, including aquifer, filter pack and screen slots and its influence on pressure losses and well performance. It could be shown, that groundwater was enriched with oxygen during the tank passage by oscillating water tables and that permeability and specific well yield generally decreased over time. The distribution of ochre deposits in the well tank showed a distinct mineral zonation with high deposition rates of manganese and iron in the filter pack at the top of the well screen. Further, interfaces of aquifer and/or filter pack were strongly affected by iron deposits. Thus, preventing ochre formation is an appropriate measure. The preventive treatment of wells with hydrogen peroxide could be such a measure, but could also be a potential source for oxygen in well and filter pack. By reviewing the latest research activities and operator’s data and by investigating at laboratory and field site scale, the current treatment procedure was evaluated. Investigations revealed a clear improvement potential for the treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Impacts of the treatment were however low, especially if incrustations were already established. Results of column batch studies and field tests did not fully prove the effectiveness of the preventive treatment, but indicated that with higher concentrated solutions and an improved treatment procedure ochre formation can be retarded and rehabilitation potential can be improved. Another approach to prevent ochre formation is the classification of well sites considering their ageing vulnerability and the development of adapted operation schedules. At least such a measure can support a sustainable construction, operation and maintenance of wells. A statistical approach was used to quantify well ageing and to identify factors promoting well performance loss. Most appropriate clogging indicators could be identified and were used to analyse worst and best site conditions with regard to their impact on ochre formation. Accordingly, a well in high distance to the next surface water with a thick groundwater layer above the well screen situated in a confined aquifer with high redox potential gains the lowest ageing potential. Compared to worst site conditions and calculated for the mean life time of a typical Berlin drinking water well, this can account for a difference in well capacity of up to 90%. In addition to that, optimized rehabilitation intervals for the identified well classes based on their ageing potential could be exemplarily determined. Based on the results of this thesis, strategies for an optimized monitoring of well ageing processes and strategies for an adapted well management aiming at the reduction of ochre formation can be developed.},

   abstract = {The BWB apply the preventive treatment with H2O2 in order to reduce bacterial activity in the wells and prevent hardening of already existing incrustations. H2O2 has strong oxidizing properties and acts as cleaning and disinfectant agent. Nearly all organisms in an aerobe environment possess catalase, an enzyme catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into water and O2. In aqueous solutions, decomposition can be catalyzed by transition metals, like iron and manganese. A disinfectant effect is caused by the appearance of hydroxyl-radicals resulting from the decomposition of H2O2 (Block, 1991b). Several studies on disinfection effects of H2O2 on biofilms revealed high elimination rates and moderate detachment rates with concentrations >1% (Exner et al. 1987; Christensen et al., 1990; Walker et al., 2003). However, biofilms that are treated frequently are able to develop a H2O2-resistance. With increasing age of the biofilms and an ongoing growth of incrustations, the disinfectant effect of H2O2 is decreasing as well. Statistical analyses of Berlin water wells indicate a reduced well ageing (in terms of changes in well capacity) of wells frequently treated with H2O2, compared to those that are not treated. Within this study, the following issues are targeted: (i) Optimization of treatment procedure in terms of o H2O2-concentration (i a) Treatment interval (i b) Contact time of H2O2-concentration (i c) H2O2-injection  (ii) Appearance of side effects of the H2O2 treatment caused by intense release of O2 (iii) Transport characteristics of H2O2 in well, gravel pack and aquifer (iv) Suitability of the H2O2 treatment to retard iron related well ageing  (v) Impact of H2O2 on rehabilitation efficiency. The research plan includes: field site investigations on the O2 distribution caused by the H2O2-treatment, combined field site and laboratory studies on treatment efficiency concerning concentrations and intervals and laboratory studies focusing on the reaction and transport mechanism of H2O2 and related O2.},

Ausgehend von den in den Teilberichten dokumentierten Recherchen und Versuchen werden dazu in Kapitel 2 zunächst der Kenntnisstand zu Beginn des Projektes zusammengefasst und ein Überblick über die Untersuchungen gegeben. Kapitel 3 unterzieht die Brunnen einer Gefährdungsanalyse und beschreibt mögliche Eintragspfade und Einflussfaktoren mit einer Bewertung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten. Die vorliegenden Daten werden in Kapitel 4 dann in eine Risikoanalyse überführt und auf Basis der Priorisierung der Gefährdungsereignisse Maßnahmen zur Minimierung von Befunden empfohlen. Indikatorkeime, ihre Überwachung sowie der Stand von Forschung und Entwicklung neuer (molekularbiologischer) Methoden zur Analyse und Früherkennung bzw. Möglichkeiten der Online-Überwachung werden im Teilbericht "Mikrobiologische Methoden: Stand der Technik" von O. Thronicker behandelt. Die deskriptive Datenanalyse vorliegender Befunddaten hinsichtlich möglicher Zusammenhänge mit bestimmten Brunneneigenschaften, insbesondere Lage, Baumerkmalen und Betriebsparametern wurde im Teilbericht "Deskriptive Datenanalyse" zusammengefasst. Die Feldversuche im Rahmen der Einzelbrunnenuntersuchung SPAsued10, die Markierungsversuche an zwei Brunnen im Wasserwerk Jungfernheide sowie die Sediment- und Wasserbeprobungen an einer Transekte entlang des Fließpfades des Uferfiltrats von der Havel zur Galerie Tiefwerder-Schildhorn sind in den entsprechenden Teilberichten dokumentiert. Die Teilberichte beschreiben jeweils die Ausgangslage zu Versuchsbeginn, die Methodik und Ergebnisse und enthalten eine ausführliche Diskussion und Schlussfolgerungen aus den Versuchen. Der hier vorliegende Synthesebericht greift die einzelnen Versuche und Ergebnisse in der Beschreibung des Kenntnisstandes nach dem Konzept eines Water Safety Plans (WSP, WHO 2009) auf. WSPs auf Wasserwerksebene wurden bislang von den BWB für sechs der neun aktiven Wasserwerke im Entwurf erstellt. Sie fokussieren auf die Aufbereitungsschritte vom Rohwasser zum Reinwasser. In RIKO-1 sollte ergänzend vor allem der Einzelbrunnen betrachtet werden. Die Risikobewertung bezieht sich daher auf die Wassergewinnung, d.h. den Weg des Wassers vom zur Uferfiltration genutzten Oberflächengewässer bis zum Eintritt des Rohwassers in die Sammelleitung. Die davor (Ressourcenschutz) und danach (Rohwasseraufbereitung) liegenden Teile des teilgeschlossenen Wasserkreislaufs werden nicht behandelt. Die ganzheitliche Betrachtung und Entwicklung eines WSPs für den gesamten Berliner Wasserkreislaufs ist Ziel im Projekt ASKURIS. Als weitere Grundlagen der Arbeiten in RIKO-1 und der zusammenfassenden Betrachtung im vorliegenden Bericht dienten u.a. das Wasserversorgungskonzept 2040 (Möller & Burgschweiger 2008), eine Fallstudie der Befunde 2003-2007 in WELLMA-1 (Gräber 2009, unveröffentlicht) sowie Forschungsarbeiten aus NASRI und IC-NASRI (Lopez-Pila & Szewzyk 2006; u.a.). Alle geplanten Untersuchungen und Zwischenergebnisse wurden regelmäßig im Projektteam diskutiert (vgl. Besprechungsprotokolle) und daraus folgend ggf. Maßnahmen zur direkten Umsetzung abgeleitet oder Versuchskonzepte angepasst.

   title = {Geological CO2 storage and other emerging subsurface activities - Best practice: monitoring strategy & methods for groundwater protection},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2014},
   abstract = {Emerging subsurface activities (ESA) describe a set of methodologies and technologies using the earths subsurface for energy production or capture and storage of carbon dioxide. The earth’s heat is used as a clean source of energy (deep geothermal systems, DGS), process-related CO2 emissions can be stored in suitable geological formations (geological CO2 storage, GCS) and since the technique of horizontal drilling was developed, the exploitation of unconventional reserves of natural gas via hydraulic fracturing (shale gas extraction, SGE) expanded. At the same time, 97% of global freshwater resources are stored in the earth's subsurface, too, so that exploitation interests may come into conflict with the issue of groundwater and environmental protection. Main objective of deliverable D 3.1 of the COSMA-1 project therefore was to identify best practices of monitoring for geological carbon storage, deep geothermal systems and shale gas extraction projects with special focus on groundwater protection. Chapter 2 summarizes current groundwater monitoring standards, including monitoring network designs for emission-based (operators) and immission-based (water suppliers) monitoring. It further presents an identification of hazards related to ESA and a brief overview about the state of regulation. Finally, knowledge gaps concerning groundwater protection are identified. Chapters 3 to 5 describe for each of the above-named types of ESA the project stages and according monitoring needs and methods. Main target was to identify the key parameters and monitoring network designs ensuring reliable groundwater monitoring. As the most relevant hazards were drilling fluids, fracking fluids and brine migration as well as the mobilisation of methane, and the most likely pathways are leakages due to insufficient well integrity, for all three ESA types, pressure, temperature and TDS were recommended as key monitoring parameters. For shale gas extraction, in addition methane emission should be monitored. Key to any monitoring is i) the baseline sampling prior to the start of subsurface activities and ii) the adequate delineation of the area of review. All further monitoring to be implemented base on site-specific considerations and the authorities’ priorities. In any case, monitoring network should include the up-gradient, down-gradient and depth component. Monitoring wells and equipment should cover the full extension of horizontal bores and additional wells should be placed above potential pathways for fluid (or brine) migration as e.g. fault systems. The use of abandoned wells for monitoring is also recommended. The conception of appropriate monitoring strategies has further to be coordinated with the competent authorities, which have to control the compliance with all requirements. Therefore, site operator and water producer should report their monitoring plans and data at regular intervals to the competent authorities. The findings were summarized by transferring them to a risk management matrix following the Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach (WHO 2009). For shale gas extraction, deliverable D 3.2 will add specific mitigation measures to reduce the previously identified risk of negative impacts on shallow groundwater. Geological carbon storage was further investigated by means of the development of a coupled model for a theoretical case study site in the North-Eastern German Basin in the scope of work package 2 of the COSMA-project (D 2.3).},

   pages = {4},
   year = {2011},
   abstract = {The capacity of drinking water wells, i.e. the yield for a given drawdown, is often decreasing after a certain time of operation. This effect is called well ageing and is due to different processes related to the geology and hydrochemistry at any given well site and to the construction and operation of these wells. The Hydrogeology workgroup and partners investigate wells in Berlin and France in terms of their ageing behaviour with the aim to determine suitable measures helping to slow down well ageing processes and optimise strategies for well operation and maintenance. A precondition for well clogging by iron incrustations is the mixing of different groundwaters with incompatible chemical properties in the well and/or within aquifer and is induced by combined hydrochemical and microbiological processes. The assessment of (i) formation of reduced/oxidized groundwater layering in the aquifer, (ii) localization of mixing zones and (iii) mixing ratios within the well was done by field and laboratory studies. The research reveals that redox condition in the well and the surrounding aquifer are subject to short to long-termed variations. These variations are caused by operation intervals of the wells and by seasonal effects. The results permit a characterization of oxygen enrichment and transport dependent on well operation, location and design and further on an input-output balancing and a modeling of incrustation rates.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {The project OXIRED was initiated to assess the potential of a combination of natural systems such as bank filtration (BF) and artificial recharge (AR) and oxidation processes in order to improve the degradability of DOC and the removal of trace organics during water treatment. In this literature study, treatment schemes, which combine subsurface passage with oxidation processes, were evaluated with regard to the potential removal of DOC and trace organics, by theoretical considerations and case study analyses. The objectives were i) to estimate the degradation of bulk organic matter and trace organics in such combined systems, ii) to assess the potential for toxic by-products and iii) to describe different possible schemes combining natural systems (BF & AR) and oxidation processes. Available data generally shows good removal of the substances identified as persistent during BF & AR by oxidation processes. Carbamazepine, for example, is poorly degradable during bank filtration, but ozonation leads to a transformation of more than 97%. If ozonation alone does not suffice, advanced oxidation processes may enhance the transformation. E.g. literature gives a values of < 50% removal of Iopamidol by ozonation. However, transformation increases up to 88% using advanced oxidation processes, such as O3/H2O2 and O3/UV. Investigations on the formation of possible toxic by-products have shown the general possibilities to control the formation of bromate by decreasing the pH, avoiding free dissolved ozone in the reactor and/or by adding H2O2. Only a low risk of exposure of the potentially forming nitrosamines in drinking water after artificial recharge could be identified. Especially the cancerogenic metabolite NDMA is degraded during subsurface passage. Three reference treatment schemes were identified: (A): surface water is treated via oxidation before infiltration into artificial recharge ponds.(B): a river bank filtration with short retention times (<5 days) is used as a pretreatment step before the successive oxidation and artificial recharge (AR). (C1/C2): oxidation is applied subsequent to subsurface passage after bank filtration and artificial recharge. Due to the possible formation of toxic by-products and the increased assimilable DOC in scheme C (Examples for C1 Mülheim Styrum-East and Le Pecq Croissy & C2 Prairie Waters Project and the Bi´eau Process) a post-treatment including disinfection after oxidation is necessary. Additional post-treatment in schemes A (implemented at Mülheim Dohne) and B depends on the redox conditions and the travel times during the subsurface passage. However, although there is a lack of practical data, the enhancement of BDOC via oxidation prior to the underground passage seems theoretically more promising than the reverse configuration. It is therefore recommended that any further experimental program in OXIRED should focus on the schemes A and B and include a cost-benefit analysis of the additional first BF step.},

   institution = {KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2006},
   abstract = {Biofoulingprozesse bereiten in kommunalen und industriellen wasserführenden Leitungssystemen große Probleme. Um dem rechtzeitig entgegenwirken zu können, müssen solche Belagsbildungen frühzeitig erkannt werden. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde eine neuentwickelte optische Messsonde von 3 in Berlin ansässigen Industriepartnern in Zusammenarbeit mit der TU-Berlin auf die praktische Eignung für die Detektion von Biofilmen, und damit hinsichtlich ihres Einsatzpotentials in der Wasserwirtschaft untersucht.    Der eingesetzte optische Sensor zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass gleichzeitig bis zu 4 verschiedene optische Parameter bei bis zu 4 verschiedenen Wellenlängen online erfasst werden können. In den Experimenten wurden Zusammenhänge zwischen den Messsignalen und der Biofilmbildung dokumentiert, durch begleitende chemisch/physikalische und mikrobiologische Untersuchungen verifiziert und erste Ansätze für den Einsatz einer solchen Sonde in wasserführenden Rohrsystemen erarbeitet.  Die Versuche wurden in zwei Abschnitten durchgeführt, wobei jeweils ein durchströmter Rohrreakor zum Einsatz kam, der neben der Messsonde mit Referenzsonden ausgestattet war. Dadurch wurden zusätzliche Bewuchsflächen auf identischen optischen Fenstern geschaffen, die über einen längeren Zeitraum begleitend mikrobiologisch analysiert werden konnten.   Im ersten Versuchsabschnitt wurde der Reaktor mit dem Ablauf der Kläranlage Ruhleben beschickt, um bei hoher Substratkonzentration in kurzer Zeit Informationen über das Ansprechverhalten der Messsonde zu erhalten und eine erste Abstimmung des optischen Systems vornehmen zu können. Zwischen dem gemessenen TOC und BDOC und der Zellzahlentwicklung (DAPI-Test) resultierten übereinstimmende Tendenzen, zwischen der Biofilmdicke und den optischen Parametern war eine grobe Korrelation erkennbar.   In den im zweiten Versuchsabschnitt mit Trinkwasser durchgeführten Experimenten korrelierten die mit dem Fouling-Sensor gemessen optischen Daten gut mit den Zellzahlen, die auf den optischen Fenstern der Referenzsonden gemessen wurden. Ein Vergleich der spektroskopischen Laboruntersuchungen von Ablaufproben des Reaktors mit den Messdaten der optischen Sonde lässt den Schluss zu, dass die dokumentierten optischen Messwerte tatsächlich durch Belagseinflüsse und nicht durch das Freiwasser bedingt sind.  Bei differenzierter Betrachtung der Ergebnisse korrelierten die Absorptionsdaten der Messsonde mit der mikrobiologisch gemessenen Zellzahlentwicklung in der Aufwuchsphase sehr gut, während die Streu- und Fluoreszenzparameter ein anderes dynamisches Verhalten zeigten. Schnelle Adsorptionsprozesse durch Wasserinhaltsstoffe wie z.B. Huminstoffe, die neben der relativ langsamen Zellvermehrung in der Aufwuchsphase charakteristisch sind, spiegelten sich besonders in einem relativ starken Anstieg des Fluoreszenzsignals wider. Bei geänderten experimentellen Bedingungen, wie z.B. Temperatur oder Nährstoffangebot, zeigten die optischen Parameter Absorption, Streuung und Fluoreszenz ein unterschiedliches Verhalten, das auch von der gewählten Wellenlänge abhängig ist. Beispielsweise zeigte die Streuung im nahen Infrarotbereich (NIR) im Gegensatz zur bei unterschiedlichen Wellenlängen gemessenen UV-Streuung einen deutlichen Anstieg. Eine Unterbrechung der Nährstoffgabe hatte parallel zu einer leichten Abnahme der Zellzahl auch eine leichte Abnahme der optischen Streuungs- und Absorptionsparameter zur Folge.  In den Untersuchungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass der eingesetzte optische Sensor ein großes Potenzial bei der Erfassung von Biofoulingprozessen besitzt, wobei die Messung mehrerer optischer Parameter bei unterschiedlichen Wellenlängen erforderlich ist. Diese ersten Untersuchungen zeigten auch sehr deutlich, dass hinsichtlich der Interpretation der gewonnenen Daten noch nicht alle Möglichkeiten des Sensors ausgeschöpft sind. So lassen die gemessenen Daten vermuten, dass mit den optischen Parametern weitere biochemische Parameter, wie zum Beispiel NAD/NADH, erfasst wurden, womit ein sehr guter Hinweis auf die Stoffwechselaktivität der Zellen im Biofilm gegeben wäre.  Um der Wasserwirtschaft ein geeignetes Werkzeug zur Verfügung stellen zu können, müssen die bisherigen Ergebnisse bestätigt werden. Insbesondere ist zu zeigen, inwieweit beginnende und fortgeschrittene Stadien von Foulingprozessen in verschiedenen und komplexen Medien sicher erkannt und dokumentiert werden können. Außerdem müssen Zusammenhänge zwischen den optischen Parametern und den unterschiedlichen Vorgängen während der Biofilmbildung im Detail erfasst werden, um Algorithmen und Kalibrierfunktionen zu entwickeln, die für die Steuerung von Antifoulingmaßnahmen in der praktischen Wasserwirtschaft nutzbar sind.},

   abstract = {The KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) is a private research and development center, created in 2000, with a status of public interest, and mainly supported by Veolia Water and Berliner Wasser Betriebe. This is where I did a six month-training period as part of my studies at the French AgroParisTech ENGREF engineering school. Within the department “Point and non-point source pollution control”, the KWB initiated a program called Aquisafe. The aim is to investigate the mitigation of trace contaminants from diffuse sources in rural and semi-rural areas to improve water quality of surface water bodies. The sustainable way of addressing pollution control is that the selected mitigation metods are natural or nature-based: namely constructed wetlands and riparian1 corridors. To develop knowledge and tools about these mitigation zones, an innovative approach was chosen when conducting the project: - The first part aims at a background study about surface water and pollutions from diffuse sources, leading to a progressive focus on key pollutants for the future of the project. The second part investigates modelling tools as diagnosis tools for the repartition and load of contaminants in a watershed. The third part contains field experiments and uses results from previous parts. The final purpose is to assess the mitigation efficiency of the systems and to optimize their design in the perspective of improving surface water quality. In charge of the first part, I did set the context of the project by reviewing background information on surface waters in Europe and associated pollutions, that move to water via soil surface run-off or subsurface run-off. After using criteria related to the Aquisafe context, the main pollutant families of interest for the rest of the screening process are pesticides used in agriculture, pollutants coming from the spreading of animal waste on land, pollutants coming from the spreading of sludge from wastewater treatment plants, pollutants from natural and extensive areas, and pollutants from transportation networks. During the study it appeared that in a rural or semi-rural area, the land use of the watershed plays a key role in the selection and assessment of priority pollutants coming from diffuse sources and entering surface waters. The importance of this factor should always be kept in mind as the project goes on. The work is still in progress concerning the review of pollutant families, and will lead to the final screening at the molecule level, providing a list of key contaminants for the other parts of the Aquisafe project. Finally the results of Aquisafe will tell if such sustainable mitigation zones can be used as a real innovative management tool of diffuse pollution in a watershed.},

   abstract = {In the rural and semi-rural environment many sources of contamination may impact surface water quality. In addition to nutrients from agricultural activities, contaminants occurring at low concentration so-called trace contaminants are a growing issue for water quality. To address this issue and investigate mitigation measures, the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin) developed a collaborative research project called Aquisafe, in association with the Indiana University – Perdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), the German Federal Agency for the Environment “Umweltbundesamt” (UBA) and Veolia Water. The project aims at investigating mitigation zones such as constructed wetlands or riparian zones to improve the quality of surface water with respect to diffuse pollution. Before using models and conducting field experiments, the first part of the project is an extensive analysis of the nature, occurrence, and risks of source water contamination in rural and semi-rural areas. This is the subject of the poster. The objectives of this first part of the project are (i) to provide background information on surface water and its use in Europe, particularly regarding drinking water supply, (ii) to investigate the characteristics of the families of pollutants that are potentially of interest, and finally (iii) to select the most relevant trace contaminants to be investigated in future field experiments. To reach these objectives, an extensive literature review was carried out, using different criteria to select the relevant families of pollutants and then the individual substances. The screening process is currently in progress and includes a collection of substance characteristics that will be used for subsequent selection, such as toxicity or persistence in the environment. Key figures and information were collected concerning the nature, use and vulnerability of surface water in Europe that provides 70% of total water abstraction (drinking water, industry and agriculture) in Europe. The main pollutant families of interest for the screening process were the following: pesticides used in agriculture (e.g. glyphosate or isoproturon), pollutants coming from the spreading of animal waste on land (e.g. veterinary pharmaceuticals or hormones), pollutants coming from the spreading of sludge from wastewater treatment plants (e.g. heavy metals or hormones), pollutants from natural areas (e.g. flame retardants in forests), and pollutants from transportation networks (e.g. heavy metals from vehicles). Consequently in a rural or semi-rural area, the land use in the watershed plays a key role in the selection and assessment of priority pollutants coming from diffuse sources and entering surface waters. The work is still in progress concerning the review of pollutant families, and will lead to the final screening at substance level, providing a list of key contaminants for the other work packages within the Aquisafe project. Eventually, corresponding data for the same issues in the United States will be added and provide a comparison between the two continents.},

   abstract = {The oxygen-consuming processes in the hypolimnia of freshwater lakes leading to deep-water anoxia are still not well understood, thereby constraining suitable management concepts. This study presents data obtained from 11 eutrophic lakes and suggests a model describing the consumption of dissolved oxygen (O2) in the hypolimnia of eutrophic lakes as a result of only two fundamental processes: O2 is consumed (i) by settled organic material at the sediment surface and (ii) by reduced substances diffusing from the sediment. Apart from a lake’s productivity, its benthic O2 consumption depends on the O2 concentration in the water overlying the sediment and the molecular O2 diffusion to the sediment. On the basis of observational evidence of long-term monitoring data from 11 eutrophic lakes, we found that the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate ranging from 0.47 to 1.31 g ofO2 m−2 d−1 (average 0.90 ± 0.30) is a function of (i) a benthic flux of reduced substances (0.37 ± 0.12 g ofO2 m−2 d−1) and (ii) an O2 consumption which linearly increases with the mean hypolimnion thickness (zH)upto ∼25 m. This model has important implications for predicting and interpreting the response of lakes and reservoirs to restoration measures.},

   abstract = {The recycling of plant-nutrients as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus from human nutrition is considered to be a preposition towards sustainable agriculture. Commonly, human excreta are collected together with waste water and other liquid wastes from households and small industries. During the treatment in central sewage-works the valuable nutrients cannot be separated from potentially harmful substances such as heavy metals. Therefore, the application of sewage-sludge on agricultural fields is strongly limited. Today, in Germany a major amount of sewage sludge is burned in waste incineration plants. This means a dissemination of phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen into the atmosphere. Phosphorus and potassium fertilisers are extracted in mines and as such non-renewable. A shortage of phosphorus to be used as fertiliser is expected to arise within the next 80 years (STEEN, 1998). Alternative Sanitation Concepts such as the separate collection and treatment of urine and faeces prevent the contamination of the plant nutrients with potentially harmful or unwanted substances from other liquid wastes. The main feature of this concept is the use of a separation toilet. It can be used in the same way as any other common flushing-toilet but has a special valve for separate urine collection. The urine can easily be stored in containers e.g. in the basement of a house and used as fertiliser. A composting process ensures hygienisation of the solid faeces separated from flushing water. Due to its low content of nitrogen all remaining waste water can be treated in a constructed wetland. The studies introduced followingly were carried out within the scope of the SCST (Sanitation System of Separate Treatment) research project. This EU-Life demonstration project is a result of the cooperation of the KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin, Berliner Wasserbetriebe, Veolia Water and Anjou Recherche. It contains a setup of a complete Alternative Sanitation system including the conversion of 10 private households and two office-buildings as well as a biogasplant and a constructed wetland in Berlin-Stahnsdorf. It was the aim of the SCST-project to demonstrate the feasibility of an alternative sanitation system working with separation toilets. Apart from the technical questions to be answered it was necessary to know how urine and faeces are to be used in agriculture. The following four questions point out the aspects which needed to be investigated in detail: (i) How are the fertilising effects of urine und faeces compared to conventional mineral fertiliser? (ii) What impact has urine to soil organisms? (iii) How much gaseous nitrogen is lost after application? (iv) Would farmers and consumers accept urine as fertiliser? In this report you will find the four mentioned aspects investigated. This was done by carrying out laboratory or field experiments as well as acceptance SCST Final Report Task 8 – Fertiliser usage – Muskolus, Humboldt University of Berlin - 4 - studies for each of them accordingly. You will find a detailed description of the methods and materials used as well as the results and statistical evaluation as appropriate. Regardless of the advantages possibly reached by a treatment of urine in the presented studies it was assumed that pure urine was used. It is still not known what kind of processing is suitable to reduce the water content of urine or any unwanted substances and whether the energy input during the treatment is justifiable or not. However, some results of the studies followingly presented may change if treated urine instead of pure urine was used.},

   abstract = {The surplus of nutrients in surface waters due to anthropogenic influences makes eutrophication an important issue in water quality in Europe. According to the Water Framework Directive of the European Union (EU-WFD) an improvement of all water bodies to a “good ecological status” is aimed. One aspect for achieving the goal is an additional reduction of nutrient immissions. In particular, the study has a focus on advanced nitrogen removal at large scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the area of Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany. A comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of a generic WWTP with 1.47 million population equivalent (pe) is carried out. The WWTP includes a secondary treatment with upstream denitrification. Sludge treatment is realized by anaerobic digestion with biogas utilization and sludge disposal in a mono-incineration plant. On basis of the generic WWTP, five scenarios for an advanced nitrogen removal are analyzed and compared within the LCA: an expansion of the denitrification reactor (ExpDeni), a retrofit to a step-feed nitrogen removal (SFNR), a biologically active filtration (BAF) as post-treatment step as well as two processes for sludge liquor treatment by deammonification (Anammox) and by an SBR-reactor (SBR). Data for energy and chemical demand, effluent quality and infrastructure are based on an existing plant from Berlin and data of nitrogen removal processes on simulations and planning data for this particular WWTP. For the life cycle impact assessment, the following categories are considered: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), marine (MEP) and freshwater eutrophication (FEP) as well as human (HTP) and freshwater ecotoxicity (FETP). Additional, the cumulative energy demand (CED) of fossil and nuclear energy resources is taken into account. For the generic WWTP two results have to be emphasized: the influence of high energy demand on potential environmental impacts and the relevance of the primary function of nutrient removal due to a high influence in eutrophication impact categories MEP and FEP. Hence, reducing electricity demand and an increased use of renewable energy resources will lead to reduced impacts. Comparing the nitrogen removal processes, SFNR is preferable to ExpDeni because of reduced energy demand (SFNR: -6%, ExpDeni: +9%) which leads to an improved environmental profile throughout all categories. Focusing on sludge liquor processes, Anammox may be recommended due to mainly lower additional impacts to SBR-process. Main issues at SBR are the high energy consumption (almost twice as high as energy demand of Anammox) and addition of methanol as carbon source. The BAF has the highest impacts in CED (+33%) and GWP (+14%) due to high energy demand for pumping and backwashing (+5%) and methanol dosing. However, favorable side-effects such as a reduction of phosphorus and heavy metal loads lead to a significant reduction in FEP (-18%) and FETP (-9%). All in all, SFNR is recommended in an overall comparison, Anammox has the second best environmental profile. BAF can be recommended if other effects in wastewater treatment are aimed at. Due to lack of data concerning trace organics, uncertainties in toxicity potential are still apparent. Besides, uncertainties in estimating N2O-emission factors have a high effect on the result of GWP. Further investigations on N2O emissions from biological treatment steps should be done to reduce the uncertainties. Finally, LCA is a powerful tool for revealing potential environmental impacts for supporting a sustainable way of decision making process.},

   abstract = {The implementation of tertiary treatment at large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) may be required in many WWTPs in Germany due to water quality targets defined in the Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) and Bathing Water Directive (EU-BWD) of the European Union. Furthermore, potential environmental risks of organic micropollutants (OMP) from anthropogenic sources (i.a. pharmaceuticals, sweeteners) could require additional treatment steps for tertiary treatment in future. EU-WFD requires a “good ecological status” of all water bodies, which can lead to a need of enhanced phosphorus removal at large WWTP (>100’000 pe), targeting an effluent quality <100μg/L TP. Moreover, if a WWTP discharges upstream of bathing water, EU-BWD requirements have to be met. Hence implementing a disinfection step might be necessary. Different options for enhanced P-removal and disinfection have already been analyzed in their economic and environmental impacts (KWB 2013). Based on these results, both targets can be adequately met by coagulation with subsequent dual media filtration (DMF) and UV-disinfection (UV). On this basis, the present study focusses on the additional integration of a process for OMP-removal into a tertiary treatment scheme. Considered technologies for OMP-removal are oxidation by ozonation and adsorption by activated carbon (AC) either by dosing powdered activated carbon (PAC) or using filtration units with granulated activated carbon (GAC), respectively. These technologies increase the additional demand of energy and chemicals for tertiary wastewater treatment. WWTPs are already one of the major contributors of electricity demand at municipality level (UBA 2008), and further treatment steps may add up significantly in this environmental impact. In the present study, different options and process configurations for OMP-removal are integrated in a tertiary treatment with advanced P-removal and UV-disinfection, and the entire tertiary treatment train is then analysed in its environmental impacts using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The goal of the LCA is to reveal the trade-off between local environmental benefits by higher effluent quality and global environmental impacts, e.g. an increasing CO2-footprint. With the methodology of LCA different tertiary treatment schemes are analysed in a holistic approach “from cradle to grave” (ISO 2006), which includes direct effects at water bodies through discharge, and indirect effects resulting from infrastructure, chemical and electricity demand by tertiary treatment and additional sludge treatment. The baseline scenario is defined as treatment of secondary effluent of an existing WWTP located in Berlin, Germany (1’500’000 pe) by DMF with coagulation and UV (Figure 1.1). Sludge from backwash of filtration units is considered in the LCA by a simplified model for sludge treatment and mono-incineration (SMIP). For integration of OMP-removal into tertiary treatment, 7 possible scenarios are compared in their environmental impacts (Figure 1.2): (1) Ozone+DMF+UV, (2) PAC-dosing+DMF+UV, (3) PAC-cycle+DMF+UV, (4) DMF+GAC-filter+UV, (5) DMF w/ GAC-layer+UV, (6) Ozone+DMF w/ GAC-layer+UV, or (7) parallel treatment by ozonation and PAC+DMF+UV, respectively. Each scenario is analysed with a low, medium, and high dosage of ozone or AC, displaying the whole range of economic feasibility and effluent quality targets (Table 1.1). The specific dosage of ozone and PAC are referred to DOC-concentration of the secondary effluent (12.8mg/l DOC). Data used for advanced P-removal and UV-disinfection are based on a previous study (Remy et al. 2014) using planning data from the WWTP operator considering process efficiency, infrastructure, energy and chemical demand. Data for OMP-removal technology are based on pilot plants and planning data from WWTP operator. For LCA, impact categories of ReCiPe Midpoint method are taken into account (Goedkopp et al. 2008), e.g. global warming potential (GWP) or freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), and cumulative energy demand (CED) of fossil and nuclear resources (VDI 2012), and USEtox indicators (Rosenbaum et al. 2008) freshwater ecotoxicity (ETP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). Environmental benefits of tertiary treatment scenarios on the global scale can be seen in the FEP and ETP indicators. TP from secondary effluent is reduced from 320μg/l to 55μg/l TP after tertiary treatment. The global USEtox indicator ETP includes preliminary impact factors for seven measured OMPs (6 pharmaceuticals, 1 herbicide), neglecting potential toxic effects of metabolites or transformation products as limitation of the multi-fate model. Removal of OMP has a positive effect on ETP in all scenarios. However, background processes and heavy metal loads play a major role in the contribution to the global ecotoxicity indicator. On the contrary, a higher energy and chemical consumption lead to a significant increase of CED and GWP due to OMP-removal (Figure 1.3). Comparing baseline scenario (DMF+UV) with the gross GWP of a large WWTP, the CO2-footprint will increase by +11% (82g CO2-eq/m³). Ozonation increases the GWP by 23% to 37% depending on ozone dosage. Main contributors for GWP are electricity and liquid oxygen demand for ozonation. Highest effects on GWP are detected for the scenario “PAC-cycle+DMF+UV” with an additional CO2-footprint of 36% or 110%, respectively, which is mainly caused by emissions during production of AC. In summary, OMP-removal can double the GWP of an existing large WWTP in the worst case and thus contributes significantly to global environmental effects. Production of AC is a crucial parameter for scenarios using GAC or PAC. Hence, a sensitivity analysis is performed changing raw materials for AC production. AC production is modelled according to available data from Bayer et al. (2005) using 3kg of hard coal as resource for activation process and generating 1kg of virgin AC. Other possible resources for AC production can be lignite or coconut shells. Varying the type of resource reveals a high uncertainty in GWP. Considering scenario “PAC+DMF+UV” a possible reduction of -23% of net GWP using coconut shells or even an increase of net GWP by +32% using lignite is possible. Since specific discharge limits for OMP removal are not defined yet, a direct comparison between the considered scenarios is not possible, as they lead to different effluent qualities in OMP concentration. Thus, in theory a low dosage of PAC (1.0g/gDOC) may be sufficient to achieve certain effluent targets, whereas ozonation could require a high dosage (1.0g/gDOC) for the same quality, or vice versa.},

   abstract = {Zusammenfassung: Momentan wird die Forderung nach einer Erweiterung von Kläranlagen um eine Stufe zur weitergehenden Elimination organischer Spurenstoffe in der Fachwelt kontrovers diskutiert. Als effiziente Verfahren werden hierfür die Oxidation durch Ozonung und die Adsorption an Aktivkohle betrachtet. Neben der Verbesserung des Gewässer- und Ressourcenschutzes bedarf die Einführung dieser Verfahren zusätzlicher Energie und erzeugt weitere damit verbundene negative Umweltauswirkungen (zum Beispiel Ausstoß von Treibhausgasen). Bei der hier durchgeführten Ökobilanz werden diese möglichen negativen Umweltauswirkungen der Verfahren zur Spurenstoffeliminierung genauer quantifiziert. Dabei werden weitere Ziele einer weitergehenden Abwasserreinigung (weitestgehende Entfernung von Phosphor mit Flockungsfiltration und saisonale UVDesinfektion) bei allen Varianten mit einbezogen, um auch den Anteil der Spurenstoffelimination an den gesamten Auswirkungen einer zukünftigen weitergehenden Abwasserreinigung zu erfassen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Ozonung oder der Einsatz von Pulveraktivkohle bzw. Kornaktivkohleadsorbern je nach geforderter Effizienz der Spurenstoffentfernung einen hohen zusätzlichen Primärenergieaufwand (+ 10-103 %) und auch ein hohes zusätzliches Treibhauspotenzial (+ 8-100 %) im Vergleich zu einer Modellkläranlage der Größenklasse 5 erzeugt. Entscheidend für den zusätzlichen Aufwand sind neben der Qualität des zu behandelnden Klärwerksablaufs (organische Stoffe als DOC) auch die Reinigungsziele für die Spurenstoffelimination und damit die notwendige Dosierung von Ozon oder Aktivkohle. Dieser Aspekt sollte zukünftig in der Diskussion über die Qualitätsziele der weitergehenden Abwasserreinigung berücksichtigt werden. },

   abstract = {Facilitating and improving decision-making in urban stormwater management is a key goal of the interdisciplinary research project “Concepts for urban rainwater management, drainage and sewage systems” (KURAS). By reinstating a more natural hydrological cycle, by increasing infiltration, evapotranspiration and stormwater reuse at the building or neighborhood level, e.g. via green roofs, pervious surfaces, swales and artificial ponds, to name but a few, stormwater management has the potential not only to reduce flooding and river degradation but also to improve landscape and habitat quality, the urban climate and resource efficiency, to reduce costs, and to respond more flexibly to uncertain future conditions. These multiple potential benefits have been valuated in a systematic way, thus providing a quantitative and comparative assessment of the effects of the various approaches to stormwater management as a basis for decision-making. An important element is the stakeholder involvement in planning in order to expose interests, resolve conflicts and to discuss existing financial, legal, administrative and knowledge-related barriers to adapted urban stormwater management. For two representative neighborhoods in Berlin, Germany, alternative and realistic stormwater management scenarios have been developed based upon an analysis of the current state and evaluated using the effect indicators. Central actors for stormwater management in Berlin are collaborating with other stakeholders in the sample neighborhoods to formulate and prioritize goals regarding the selection of measures, to discuss the evaluation results and to develop transition strategies. The presentation will focus on this experience of stakeholder participation in the design of stormwater management systems on the neighborhood scale. It will present preliminary findings to be translated into recommendations for policy makers and practitioners.},

   abstract = {Der Großteil der bundesdeutschen Binnengewässer wird bis 2015 nicht den guten ökologischen Zustand erreichen, der von der EU-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie gefordert wird. Bisher ging man davon aus, dass die Gewässergüte in erster Linie durch Phosphor bestimmt wird. In jüngster Zeit mehrten sich aber Hinweise, dass in vielen Gewässern auch Stickstoff eine entscheidende Steuergröße der  Phytoplanktonentwicklung darstellt. Daher wird die Reduzierung von Stickstoffeinträgen gefordert. Die Kosten für Maßnahmen zur Reduktion der Stickstoffeinträge aus punktuellen (beispielsweise Kläranlagen) und diffusen Quellen (beispielsweise aus der Landwirtschaft) werden um ein Vielfaches höher geschätzt im Vergleich zu Maßnahmen zur Reduktion von Phosphoreinträgen. Ob Maßnahmen zur Stickstoffreduktion ökologisch wirksam werden, kann aufgrund unzureichender Kenntnisse zur Herkunft, Umsetzung und Wirkung von Stickstoff derzeit nicht eingeschätzt werden. Daher fordern öffentliche und wirtschaftliche Maßnahmenträger nachdrücklich eine Klärung des Nutzens von Stickstoffelimination. An diesem Punkt setzt NITROLIMIT an. Es sollte eine fundierte wissenschaftliche Grundlage zur Beurteilung des Einflusses von Stickstoff auf die Gewässergüte geschaffen, die Kosten und Nutzen von Maßnahmen zur Verringerung von Stickstoffeinträgen analysiert und darauf basierend Empfehlungen für eine nachhaltige Gewässerbewirtschaftung erarbeitet werden.},

These new sanitation concepts have the target of saving and reuse the water as well as the nutrients. The approach of being a more appropriate technology can be demonstrated by life cycle analysis (Peter-Fröhlich et al, 2007). Due to the lack of implementation and long time experiences detailed cost comparison are not available yet. First estimations have been done and have shown a tendency, but detailed investigations have been missing. The results of the SCST-project, which represents an experience of four years implementation and operation of a new sanitation concept, will be used for a cost comparison of different sanitation systems. It is obvious that the prerequisite for a successful implementation beside the technical applicability is the demonstration of the systems benefits. These new sanitation systems will receive only acceptance, when economical benefits or other significant benefits will support their introduction. Therefore studies of cost comparisons are necessary and an important issue.},

   abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden die Managementmaßnahmen zur Sanierung des Berliner Halensees beurteilt. Der Halensee liegt am westlichen Ende des Kurfürstendamms und wird als Naherholungsort und Badegewässer genutzt. Er wird ausschließlich von Regenwasser gespeist, das von den umliegenden Straßen in die Trennkanalisation und von dort in den See fließt. Durch diesen Regenwasserzufluss wird der See stark mit Keimen und eutrophierenden Nährstoffen sowie einer Reihe von Schadstoffen belastet. Vor allem wegen der Keimbelastung wurde 2003 ein Badeverbot für den Halensee durch die Stadt Berlin verhängt. Um diese Belastung zu reduzieren wurde in den 90er Jahren ein Teil des Einzugsgebietes an der AVUS (Stadtautobahn) abgekoppelt und 2007 ein Retentionsbodenfilter (RBF) zur Filterung eines Großteils des Zuflusses gebaut. Eine Besonderheit des Halensees ist der Zufluss von Straßentausalz im Winter, wodurch das Tiefenwasser halin geschichtet ist. Diese Dichteschichtung hat einen starken Einfluss auf die Limnologie des Sees und dadurch auch auf potentielle, weitere Managementmaßnahmen. Im Sommerhalbjahr sinkt durch die Schichtung der vertikale Austausch zwischen Tiefenwasser und Oberflächenwasser beinahe auf das Niveau der molekularen Diffusion von Salzen im Bereich von 10-8 m2/s. Die Tiefenschicht wird zwar bei der folgenden Herbstmischung etwas in ihrer Stärke reduziert, die untersten ~2 m bleiben aber bestehen. Erst bei neuerlicher Straßensalzung im Winter gelangt frisches, salzhaltiges Wasser in den tiefsten Bereich. Eine Analyse der Salz- und Wasserbilanz hat gezeigt, dass durch Einmischen von oberflächennahem Wasser in das zufließende Salzwasser das Tiefenwasser im Winter komplett ausgetauscht und in den folgenden Monaten mit dem oberflächennahen Wasser gemischt werden kann. Bezüglich Stoffdynamik konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass sich gelöste, reduzierte Stoffe im anaeroben Tiefenwasser über das Sommerhalbjahr akkumulieren und teilweise im Herbst und Winter in den restlichen Wasserkörper gemischt werden. Dabei gelangt allerdings nur 10 bis 15 % des im Tiefenwasser gelösten Phosphors in das Oberflächenwasser, was wahrscheinlich dadurch erklärt werden kann, dass der Großteil vorher mit oxidiertem Eisen gefällt wird. Allerdings kann das ausgeprägte Zehrungspotenzial der im Tiefenwasser akkumulierten, reduzierten Substanzen zu einer starken Sauerstoffabnahme im Winter auf unter 2 mg/l an der Seeoberfläche führen, was einen stark negativen Effekt auf die Ausbildung einer natürlichen aquatischen Fauna haben dürfte. Mit der Auswertung der langjährigen Standardmessungen der Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Gesundheit, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz konnte keine Wirkung durch die Abkopplung der AVUS festgestellt werden. Der Retentionsbodenfilter hingegen scheint einen deutlichen positiven Effekt auf die Wasserqualität zu haben, so konnten statistisch signifikante Verbesserungen bei der Sichttiefe und der Phosphorbelastung nachgewiesen werden. Über ein angepasstes Phosphor-Modell nach Vollenweider wurde gezeigt, dass die durch den RBF erwartete Abnahme der Gleichgewichtskonzentration des Phosphors von ~0,08 auf ~0,04 mg/l vermutlich bereits erreicht ist. Eine Anwendung des Modells auf weiterführende Managementmaßnahmen weist darauf hin, dass eine weitere Abnahme der Phosphorkonzentration (i) um 0.006 - 0.009 mg/l durch jährliches Abpumpen und Behandeln der Tiefenschicht und (ii) um 0.014 mg/l durch Anschluss weiterer Regenwasserzuflüsse an den RBF erreicht werden könnte. Allerdings würde der See in beiden Fällen knapp im eutrophen Bereich bleiben. Durch die anhaltende Produktivität dürfte auch die Problematik des hohen Zehrungspotenzials des Tiefenwassers in allen Szenarien erhalten bleiben. Eine deutliche Verringerung der Sauerstoffproblematik könnte allenfalls durch eine Abpumpung des Tiefenwassers kurz vor der Herbstmischung erreicht werden.},

Der Fragebogen mit insgesamt 16 Fragen (-> Anhang A) zielt darauf ab, einen bundesweiten Überblick zum Brunnenbetrieb und unterschiedlichen Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen derjenigen Wasserversorger zu erhalten, die eigene Brunnen betreiben. Die vorliegende Auswertung wurde am Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin durchgeführt. Nicht enthalten sind die vier ersten Fragen mit den allgemeinen Angaben des beantwortenden Unternehmens und einer Frage zum Thema Energieeffizienz (Seite 1 des Umfragebogens). Diese wurden durch den DVGW selbst ausgewertet (vgl. Plath and Wichmann 2009). Der brunnenbezogene Teil (Seiten 2 und 3) enthielt die vier Themenkomplexe: (1) Stammdaten (Fragen 5 bis 7) Es wurden die absolute Anzahl der in Betrieb befindlichen Brunnen und ihr durchschnittliches Alter erfragt. Diese Fragen dienen der Klassifizierung und Auswertung. Den Brunnenneubau betreffend, wurde eine Angabe zur Budgetplanung erbeten, um die folgenden Fragen zu Brunnenzustand, Alterung und Regenerierung in Bezug zum Neubau setzen zu können. (2) Brunnenbetrieb, Brunnenzustand und Alterung (Fragen 8 bis 11). Zum Brunnenbetrieb wurden die Art der Brunnensteuerung und die während des Betriebes erfassten Daten und Intervalle zur Betriebsüberwachung abgefragt, ebenso die Methoden und Intervalle zur Brunnenzustandsermittlung. (3) Brunnenregenerierung (Fragen 12 bis 14) Die Fragen zur Notwendigkeit, Veranlassung und Erfolgsbemessung von Regenerierungen dienen der Charakterisierung der Instandhaltungsstrategie. (4) Betriebsstrategie (Fragen 15 und 16) Abschließend wurde nach der Betriebsstrategie und einer möglichen Einflussnahme auf die Brunnenalterung durch Änderungen im Betrieb gefragt. Ziel der Auswertung ist es, den Stand der Praxis der Betriebsführung von Brunnen zu erarbeiten. Durch die gekoppelte Auswertung aller vier Themenkomplexe kann weiterhin geprüft werden, inwiefern die festgestellten Betriebs- und Instandhaltungsstrategien von der Größe des Betreibers oder der Altersstruktur der Brunnen abhängen. Durch den Vergleich der erarbeiteten Ergebnisse mit den in DVGW-Arbeitsblatt W125 (DVGW 2004) festgehaltenen Empfehlungen Forschungskann Raum für Verbesserungen, wie z.B. oder Weiterbildungsbedarf identifiziert werden.

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {WELLMA-1, WP 1.2 includes a statistical analysis of Berlin and French well data. The aim is to identify parameters by which the extent of iron related clogging can be assessed and which can be used for grouping the wells for further investigations. The data analysis is based on data on well construction, water chemistry and well operation for about 615 wells in Berlin and 47 in France. The approach is first to do a descriptive analysis of the datasets. It shows amongst others that the French data are not extensive enough to be included in further statistical analysis. They were therefore interpreted individually and added as annex to the report. In the second step, a reliable indicator for iron related clogging in the Berlin wells is identified. This is done by testing the significance of differences in parameters recommended by BWB (Qs, number of H2O2-treatments and results of TV-camera inspections) that indicate either intense clogging or no clogging. The analysis of the reduced dataset reveals that TV-camera inspections are the most reliable cloggingindicator for the Berlin wells for statistical analysis with the current database. Thirdly, the relation of all available constructional, hydro-chemical and operational parameters is checked for four different stages of clogging indicated by the TV-camera inspections. It can be stated that most wells reveal increasing clogging with increasing well age and decreasing depth of the first filter. Clogged wells are characterized often by lower iron and higher manganese and nitrate concentrations, a higher mean total discharge and more operating hours than wells without clogging indication. Finally, the clogging indicator is evaluated by a multiple linear regression. For this, the dependent variable clogging is linked to the ten variables, which are obviously related to clogging processes. Although all comprised parameters are partly related to the clogging intensity of the wells, only well age, depth of the first filter, iron and manganese concentrations as well as operating hours and total discharge have an explanatory value for clogging. However, their total explanatory value of 20% of the variance in clogging is low. Either the most relevant parameters to identify clogging are missing or the selected parameters reveal too much data variability. This can be due to temporal and depth oriented variations what could not be included in the recent analysis. Measurements in mixed raw water cannot characterize all processes involved in iron related clogging. Therefore, several recommendations of well operation and monitoring are given to improve the explanatory power of the data. The most important ones are the development of a more detailed matrix for the evaluation of well condition by TV-camera inspections and an improvement of measurements of specific capacity Qs by constant discharge rates and fully documented initial step pumping tests. Groups of wells that would be useful for more detailed field investigations and further data analysis are: (i) wells with different depth of the first filter, (ii) wells with significant differences in mean discharges (and similar construction and number of switchings), (iii) wells with different amounts of switchings, (iv) wells with similar number of switchings but different filter lengths or pump capacities and (v) wells of different age, but otherwise same construction and operational characteristics.},

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is scarcely documented for stormwater systems despite their ubiquitous imple- mentation. LCA modelling quantified the environmental impacts associated with the materials, con- struction, transport, operation and maintenance of different stormwater treatment systems. A pre- fabricated concrete vortex unit, a sub-surface sandfilter and a raingarden, all sized to treat a func- tional unit of 35 m3 of stormwater runoff per event, were evaluated. Eighteen environmental mid-point metrics and three end-point ‘damage assessment’ metrics were quantified for each system's lifecycle. Climate change (kg CO2 eq.) dominated net environmental impacts, with smaller contributions from human toxicity (kg 1,4-DB eq.), particulate matter formation (kg PM10 eq.) and fossil depletion (kg oil eq.). The concrete unit had the highest environmental impact of which 45% was attributed to its maintenance while impacts from the sandfilters and raingardens were dominated by their bulky ma- terials (57%) and transport (57%), respectively. On-site infiltrative raingardens, a component of green infrastructure (GI), had the lowest environmental impacts because they incurred lower maintenance and did not have any concrete which is high in embodied CO2. Smaller sized raingardens affording the same level of stormwater treatment had the lowest overall impacts reinforcing the principle that using fewer resources reduces environmental impacts. LCA modelling can serve as a guiding tool for practitioners making environmentally sustainable solutions for stormwater treatment.},

   abstract = {One way of coping with water shortness is through reusing wastewater. In order to enhance potable water production in sites dealing with water shortness, treated wastewater can be fed into an intermediate storage system, generally a natural water reservoir from which drinking water is produced. This procedure is called indirect potable reuse. Although this technique may be an innovative way of coping with water shortness, little is known about the effect of this procedure concerning environmental and human health. In order to find more about the environmental and health human risks arising from indirect potable reuse technologies a risk assessment was carried over in the French Department of Vendée. This site deals with water shortness from May to October through a significantly enhanced water consumption in the coastal aera of this department caused by the increase of tourism activities and intensified crop irrigation. To achieve this task 35 different organic micropollutants, in its majority pesticides and pharmaceuticals were studied. Therefore, a risk assessment on water reuse technologies was performed at the site of concern. Furthermore, the impact of two tertiary treatments developed within the framework of the European DEMOWARE project on minimising arising risks was also taken into account. Results showed that 16 substances present a potential risk to the environment and/or to human health at the WWTP effluent. Similar results were achieved in fresh water, in this case 14 compounds have a risk quotient higher than 1 indicating a risk for both, health and environment. Furthermore, outcomes from the tertiary treatments risk characterisation showed that none of the studied tertiary techniques is cappable of reducing environmental and health risks for all substances to acceptable levels (RQ < 1). Same results were achieved for the risk characterisation in fresh water.},

   abstract = {The main goal of this project is to develop new sustainable sanitation concepts which have significant advantages in relation to ecological as well as to economical aspects compared to the conventional systems (end-of-pipe-system). After successful project completion the new sanitation concepts should be used in Berlin areas, where sewer systems are not installed and these concepts are appropriate, as well as other locations (national and international). The technical management of the project has been achieved as foreseen, but the administrative project manger has changed in July 2005 since the head of the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water has changed. All technical equipments, besides of the bio-gas plant, are realised. The bio-gas plant will be installed about the end of 2005. In contrary to the EU-proposal the concept with vacuum separation toilets has been installed for technical reasons in the office building instead in the apartment house. Before installing of these toilets gravity separation toilets have been operated for 1 ½ years. Furthermore not in 15 but in 10 flats of the apartment house was it possible to install gravity separation toilets. The addition tasks Life-Cycle-Assessment (Task 5), Industrial style urine treatment for utilization (Task 7) and Fertiliser usage (Task 8) undertaken by different Universities are in the works. The users accept the separation toilets in general, but more the gravity than the vacuum separation toilets. Both have to be improved, especially the flush. The worse assessment for the vacuum separation toilets was expected since they are altered gravity separation toilets. An optimised vacuum separation toilet is not available on the market at present. The results from the faeces separator show that far the most solids can be retained in the filter bags, but there is still a high solids-concentration in the filtrate. For huge settlements a different, continuously working separator is necessary. Due to the high solid concentration in the faecal filtrate the soil filter as a pre-treatment step was blocked very soon and went out of operation. With the 2-chamber septic tank for greywater and faecal filtrate treatment an effluent quality could be obtained which does not lead to clogging of the downstream constructed wetland. The results of the constructed wetland are as expected. From the work of Task 5 and the experiments of Task 7 no reliable results are available until now. The experiments of Task 8 show that the fertilising results from the urine are similar with those from mineral fertilisers. Until the end of the project the different tasks will continue. The digestion of the faeces from the vacuum separation toilets with the bio-gas plant will start in January 2006. In relation to the financial issues 790,482 € (51 %) of the total eligible costs of 1,552,116 € and 1,230,640 € (55 %) of the total real costs of 2,223,474 € respectively have been spent until now.

A historically founded system of 63 pump stations is used for the delivery and distribution of combined water and wastewater from the collection systems via long force mains to six wwtps. Simultaneously, in case of rainfall events the pumps act as variable throttles on the outflow of the combined sewerage and activate the inline sewer capacities. High demands are formulated by the water authority to the emissions out of the waste water system into the sensible water bodies. Five of six wwtps of the city are situated in the surrounding area of Berlin. Due to the long distances between the pump stations in the inner city and the wwtps, the time until the dilution effect of the stormwater will be noticed at the inlet of the wwtp may last several hours. Due to the increased delivery rate at the pump stations of the combined sewer system during stormwater runoff (twice the dry weather peak flow), the pollution load at the wwtp increases immediately in the same amount. Due to the enlargement of storage within the combined sewer systems until the year 2020 to meet higher demands of the water authority, the total duration of a raised inflow to the wwtp during and after rain events will increase. To furthermore keep the processes at the wwtp stable (especially the nitrogen removal) the construction of a storage tank at the inlet of the wwtp (=outlet of the pressure main) as an option shall be taken under research. The volume of the storage tank is not only determined by the quantity but also by the quality of the inflow  To provide evidence, that the new version of InfoWorks 9.5 CS® is able to calculate the flow and pollution processes in the pressure main network, a diploma thesis is carried out at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water with the participation of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe},

   title = {ISM - Integrated Sewage Management - Final Research Report},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2006},
   abstract = {The development of the integrated control of sewage network and wastewater treatment plant has progressed during the last decade. Nevertheless, an operational implementation of the concepts for huge, complex systems has hardly been realised. That was an obvious reason to initiate the project "Integrated Sewage Management (ISM)". The ISM project aimed at the development of strategies for an integrated management of the Berlin sewage system consisting of sewer networks (both, combined and separate system), pump stations, pressure mains and wwtp. For these purposes a numerical model of the collection system has been built up. Those catchments have been chosen that have a significant quantity of wastewater and are connected to at least one of the three main wastewater treatment plants of Berlin (Ruhleben, Waßmannsdorf and Schönerlinde).  To enable an evaluation of total emissions it was necessary to incorporate not only catchment area and collection system but also the wwtp into the model. Furthermore, the Berlin specific transport of wastewater through pressure mains had to be considered. Both, advective pollutant transport and the limiting pressure situation had to be taken into account. An integrated model of collection system, pressure mains and wwtp has been set up for the catchment of wwtp Ruhleben for the study of a global control concept.  Those processes that were of particular importance for the control concepts or had a significant influence on the criteria (derived from the objectives) had to be simulated adequately. Hence, for the Berlin model the main attention was paid to an accurate reproduction of in-pipe storage activation and the transport of wastewater through the pressure pipes. A sufficient set of data was available to model the system structure. For process parameter estimation the necessary information was taken from the operational SCADA system. Some gaps in the data could be closed by additional measurement campaigns (Bln VII, 2001; Bln X, 2002; Heiligensee, 2003). For modelling the collection system the dynamic flow routing model InfoWorks CS of Wallingford Software Limited has been chosen due to its user-friendliness (window navigation, GIS) and comprehensiveness (pollutant load calculation, long-time simulation, spatial rainfall distribution, rtc module). A suitable approach to the simulation of the Berlin pressure mains was found to be based on EPANET 2 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The software SIMBA® 5 of ifak System GmbH has been used to simulate the dynamic treatment processes. For the activated sludge conversion part the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM 1) has been used. The three models have been coupled in sequence on the basis of simple input and output files. Further on, in the framework of three sub studies the ISM model has been applied to operational questions. The applicability of the ISM model for the assessment of the impact of the NPA control on the wwtp was tested. NPA stands for “new pump automatic (Neue Pumpen Automatik)” and signifies a control concept that is implemented in the framework of the LISA project (BWB). The inflow to wwtp Schönerlinde has been simulated for one rain event and the NPA control of the pump stations could be simulated well on the basis of the InfoWorks rtc module. Furthermore, the ISM model has been applied to evaluate a concept for a level dependant real-time control (Pegelgesteuerte Förderstromregelung) of sewage pump stations. The idea of the concept was to build an easy function that allowed continuously varying the pumpage and implicitly managing available inline storage capacities within the trunk sewers. The objective was to smooth the delivery towards the treatment plant to avoid peak loads. The evaluation showed that it is possible to manage available inline storage volume by applying the control function. But only if there is an adequate retention volume of around 60.0 m³/ha Aimp or more a significant improvement of the flow characteristic towards the wwtp is possible. Consequently, in Berlin only two catchments have the potential for the introduced control concept (Charlottenburg III und Ruhleben).  Finally, the effects and the benefit from global pump station control in comparison to local control have been studied on the basis of the integrated model. The assessment of the Berlin drainage system that was carried out before arrived at the conclusion that there is a high potential for the control of the total system. The positive rating can partly be ascribed to the high storage volume that can be activated within the trunk sewers and the high number of pump stations that are used as actuators. However, this potential is already used by locally controlling the pump stations and storing sewage in the collectors. The potential of a global control of sewage pump stations arises from the non-uniform distribution of rainfall and the non-uniform distribution of storage volumes over the system. Those conditions usually lead to a non-uniform utilisation of storage capacities and further on to sewer overflows that cannot be balanced by local control. A look on the simulated total emissions showed that concerning discharged quantities the load from the wwtp is highly dominant, since most of the time (under dry weather conditions) wwtp effluents are the only impact on the receiving water. Furthermore, the global control concept only works during rain situation and does not have an influence on dry weather effluents. Consequently, the influence of global control on yearly total emissions is marginal. Nevertheless, it could be shown that global control can avoid peak load situations at the inflow to the wwtp and consequently reduce peak loads in the effluent.  The control concepts had a significant influence on the emissions from combined sewer overflows. The reduction of sewer overflows plays a prominent role since they present a highly dynamic impact on the water body. The simulations showed that on average during periods of cso 2.5 t COD/h enter the receiving water. Compared to that load the continuous impact from the wwtp effluent was only 0.4 t COD/h. Moreover, due to the high fraction of biodegradable organic substrate the impact from combined sewer overflows is of special relevance. In contrary to the refractory COD from wwtp effluents, 60 % of the COD from combined sewer overflows are biodegradable leading to extreme oxygen depletion within the receiving water.  It could be shown that under current conditions at the wwtp (rain weather capacity of wwtp Ruhleben = 6700 l/s) a local control (= local automation) of the pump stations has an adverse effect on the performance of the sewage system. In contrary to an optimum coordination of the pump stations local control leads to an overloading of the wwtp and an increase of emissions from combined sewer overflows by 9 % (volume), 15 % (COD) and 20 % (TKN). Due to that reason the current operation  provides for manual interventions in case of rain events to coordinate the delivery of the pump stations. This necessity will persist under the LISA automation. Assuming a future upgrade of wwtp Ruhleben and an increase in rain weather capacity up to 7650 l/s, global pump station control will result in cso emissions that are 19 % (volume), 20 % (COD) and 25 % (TKN) below that under local control (= local automation).  The major deliverable of the ISM project is the model for the Berlin collection system (18 combined and 29 separate sewer systems that are connected to the three main wastewater treatment plants Ruhleben, Waßmannsdorf and Schönerlinde). The further application and maintenance of the sewer model will take place at BWB, department NA-G. The scope of studies that will be supported by the model covers operational planning as well as general, conceptual and investment planning (storage optimisation, problem of parasite water).  Concerning the implementation of the global control concept that has been developed in the framework of the ISM project first tests shall be carried out in 2006 and 2007. Therefore, the follow-up project EVA (Entscheidungshilfesystem zur Verbundsteuerung von Abwasserpumpwerken / Decision support system for global control of sewage pump stations) was planned at KWB to enable support and a further cooperation between KWB and BWB. The algorithm has to be adapted to the operational and technical boundary conditions and a detailed practical planning in terms of control engineering has to be carried out. The main prerequisite for an implementation of the introduced control concept is the technical ability of the pump stations to increase delivery beyond the value of 2 * Qd,16. Simultaneously, an authorisation is necessary to introduce a flexible regulation of the pump station’s rain weather delivery off the value of 2 * Qd,16 as demanded nowadays by the Berlin water authority. If the necessary data is available (usually given by the existing scada system of BWB) and if the used pumps can be controlled according to the above-stated technical requirements, thestudied control concept can be implemented without any further constructional investment.},

   abstract = {The centre of Berlin, Germany, is drained by a combined sewer system. The receiving waters Havel and Spree are characterized by low flow velocities and an increased risk of eutrophication. High demands towards a reduction of the emission loads of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) down to 20 % of the mean annual runoff load of TSS, COD and BOD5 are formulated by the Berlin Water Authority. Therefore a pollution control plan will be carried out until the year 2020 that will lead to a storage enlargement of the combined sewer system by 100 %. To assess if these efforts will lead to the expected water quality of the receiving water regarding the objectives of the European Water Framework Directive, a method will be developed to evaluate in advance the achievable improvement. Starting from the actual status of the water body this model based method should allow for an estimation, if the good status will be achieved after the realization of the measures of storage upgrading in the sewer system. The study currently concentrates on the integrated water quality modelling of the high dynamic processes in the sewer system and the receiving water. The paper focuses on the simulation of oxygen concentration in the receiving water.},

   abstract = {The intention of the work package 5.2 is to analyze the function and relevance of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) techniques with a main focus on Riverbank Filtration (RBF) to enable sustainable water resources management, especially in developing or newly industrialized countries. For this aim three RBF sites in Delhi were equipped with groundwater observation wells and sampled monthly for determination of surface and groundwater quality. This report includes information of more than 150 samples from surface- and groundwater, which were analyzed for a broad series of chemical and physicochemical parameters. For each sample, physicochemical parameters were determined in situ (pH, T, ORP, EC, DO) along with alkalinity, nitrite, ammonia and hydrogensulphide content by the Freie Universität Berlin (FUB) and the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD). Additionally, water samples were collected and prepared under appropriate conditions for analysis of inorganic substances (major ions, heavy metals and other inorganic substances) and stable isotopes at FUB laboratories and microbiological parameters and organic contaminants at IIT laboratories. At FUB, in general all parameters were determined monthly except for some heavy metals for which the analysis is very time consuming and costly. For these metals, three sampling campaigns (monsoon, pre- and postmonsoon) were selected for analysis to get an overview of possible contaminations. Investigations on RBF are being performed at three different field sites within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), two of them on the banks of River Yamuna (Palla and Nizamuddin) and one of them at it’s major tributary in the Delhi stretch, called Najafgarh Drain (Najafgarh). At each of the field sites, at least five piezometers were constructed with varying depths and distances from the surface water. For each field site, groups of piezometers were built, to differentiate surface water and piezometers tapping shallow, medium and deep groundwater. For each parameter distribution and range of the values are shown with boxplots and compared to the German and the Indian drinking water standards. At the Palla field site positive effects during bankfiltration can be observed for several heavy metals like Pb, Al and Cu, while no significant changes or an increase in the concentration can be observed for Fe and Mn, respectively. Other substances like As, NO2- and Ammonia decrease during underground passage while no significant changes or an increase in the concentration can be observed for B and F, respectively. Only Fluoride exceeds the threshold for drinking water standard (Indian standard 1.5 mg/l) and must be considered as critical. At the Nizamuddin field site positive effects during bankfiltration can be observed only for one heavy metal (Al), while no significant changes can be observed for Pb and Cu and an increase in the concentration can be observed for Fe and Mn. Other substances like As, F and Ammonia increase during the underground passage while no significant changes or an decrease in the concentration can be observed for B and NO2-, respectively. At this field site elevated concentrations of several substances like As, Fe, Mn, F and NH4 will make a post-treatment necessary. At the Najafgarh field site the main constraints is the high salinity of the groundwater and the seasonal disavailability of fresh surface water. Due to the high mineralization of the groundwater a possible RBF site must be situated very close to the drain with shallow filter screens in order to obtain a high share of bank filtrate. The design and the potential capabilities of RBF facilities are currently subject to ongoing work and cannot evaluated finally. The sampling campaigns carried out so far are very useful to evaluate i) the seasonal changes in the surface water and ii) the depth dependent changes of the ambient groundwater. It needs to be taken into account that nitrogen species will promote the occurrence of problematic substances like ammonia, nitrite or nitrate due to a load with untreated sewage. Fluoride is expected to be no problematic substance.},

   title = {Identification of existing mitigation systems that can attenuate nitrates during high flow events from drained, agricultural fields},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {The project Aquisafe assesses the potential of selected near-natural mitigation systems, such as constructed wetlands or infiltration zones, to reduce diffuse pollution from agricultural sources and consequently protect surface water resources. A particular aim is the attenuation of nutrients and pesticides. Based on the review of available information and preliminary tests within Aquisafe 1 (2007-2009), the second project phase Aquisafe 2 (2009-2012) is structured along the following main components: (i) Development and evaluation of GIS-based methods for the identification of diffuse pollution hotspots, as well as model-based tools for the simulation of nutrient reduction from mitigation zones. (ii) Assessment of nutrient retention capacity of different types of mitigation zones in international case studies in the Ic watershed in France and the Upper White River watershed in the USA under natural conditions, such as variable flow. (iii) Identification of efficient mitigation zone designs for the retention of relevant pesticides in laboratory and technical scale experiments at UBA in Berlin. The following report focuses on (ii), providing an overview of existing mitigation systems that may reduce transport of agricultural pollutants to surface waters, with a particular focus on nitrate. The report is based on an extensive review of scientific literature as well as practical guidelines. The review emphasizes on systems, which can treat pollutant loads from agricultural fields with surface or tile drainage. Such mitigation systems could play an important role in intensely used agricultural areas, where existing efforts in farm or crop management are not sufficient to reach water quality goals in receiving rivers. This is typically the case for agricultural catchments with high ratio of artificial drainage, which allows an almost complete transfer of water and contaminants, particularly during high flow events. For each identified mitigation system, its general approach, performance against nitrates and other contaminants, boundary conditions as well as expected cost are given. The systems are structured according to their place on the pathway between field and surface water into 1. systems which attempt to reduce contaminant loads in the drainage pipes and ditches (section 2), 2. systems, which can be placed between drainage system and surface water (section 3), 3. systems, which can be placed in the receiving surface water (section 4). The review shows that there are a number of feasible options with the potential to mitigate NO3 - pollution from drained agricultural land. The most promising approaches with high removal potential were found to be: - controlled drainage (section 2.2), - bioreactors at the tile level (section 2.3.2), - reactive swales (section 2.4.2), - constructed wetlands (section 3.2) and - river-diversion wetlands (section 4.2.2). Most practical experience exists for constructed wetlands with surface flow (globally) and for controlled drainage (mainly in the USA), whereas the other systems are currently at an experimental state. v For a model agricultural area, the above systems resulted in expected nitrate reduction between 14 and 82 % and cost efficiencies between 23 and 246 € kg-N-1. In terms of absolute nitrate removal, (i) wood chip walls parallel to tile drains and (ii) constructed wetlands with straw as carbon source were found to be most effective. However, for both systems there are relatively few experiences so further testing will be necessary. Regarding cost efficiency, (iii) constructed surface flow wetland with low construction cost (dam) and (iv) controlled drainage are most efficient. Whereas constructed surface flow wetlands can be implemented independently, drainage control structures need to be managed by farmers, which requires their active cooperation and proper training.},

   abstract = {Rural watersheds often face diffuse pollution problems due to agricultural activities. In the Ic watershed in Brittany (France), nitrate concentrations in rivers frequently exceed the EUthreshold of 50 mg-NO3 L-1, despite various actions to reduce the impact from agriculture. As a result, other solutions are considered, such as mitigation systems that can prevent transfer of agricultural pollutants from cropland to the streams. Constructed wetlands have been shown to fit this aim, because they can reach significant N removal for water residence times above ~12 hours, can be implemented decentrally within rural watersheds, while meeting cost and policy requirements. However, constructed wetlands require space, which is particularly scarce and costly in intensively used agricultural watersheds. As a consequence, it was decided to test a more area-effective solution in three pilot systems. On the one hand land-use itself was optimized (i) at site 1 by placing two wetlands with same inflow and dimension on an area of minor agricultural value adjacent to a stream (one surface and one subsurface-flow, both 20 x 10 meters) and (ii) at site 2 by building an elongated infiltration wetland (45 x 2 meters) directly in an existing drainage ditch, thus preventing any use of agricultural surface. In both cases farmers agreed to the placement of the wetlands free of charge. On the other hand it was attempted to raise the areal removal efficiency, with a focus on denitrification, since nitrate is of most concern with inflow concentrations to the sites ranging between 30 and 66 mg-NO3 L-1. This increase in denitrification is attempted (a) by increasing the range of anoxic zones within the wetlands and (b) by adding carbon sources. For (a) one wetland at each site is filled with gravel with bottom outlets to enforce underground passage. Moreover saturation level within the infiltration wetlands and thus hydraulic retention time, can be controlled at drain outlets. For (b) organically rich soil is added to both wetlands at site 1 and carbon sources are mixed with the gravel at site 2. The three wetlands have been constructed in 2010 and are currently monitored for flow and water quality at inlets, as well as at surface and subsurface outlets. The monitoring will allow the calculation of substance mass balances for the entire rain season, expected from December 2010 to May 2011.},

It could be demonstrated that the new sanitation concepts may have cost advantages depending on the situation. This was a further motivation starting a pilot project near Berlin testing the above mentioned toilet systems under realistic conditions. The operation of the gravity separation toilets concept started in October 2003.},

   title = {NOM-fouling in low flux UF membrane systems},
   year = {2007},
   abstract = {Access to microbiologically and chemically safe water is limited not only in developing countries, but also in transition countries and even in remote areas of developed countries. For these cases, decentralized water supply concepts such as point-of-use (POU), point-of-entry (POE) or small-scale system (SSS) technologies can be promising alternatives to centralized treatment concepts. Membrane-based treatment systems have gained importance for drinking water treatment in the developed countries. In principle, application of membrane technology is attractive also for the transition and developing countries, because it provides absolute barriers for control of hygienic hazards (Ultrafiltration (UF)) and because the modular construction enables implementation on each possible scale size. However membrane technology is still not affordable for the poorest part of the world population. The sustainable application of POU membrane system presumes that system should be operated without or with limited addition of chemicals, with limited possibility of regular backflushing and with low pressure, presumably hydrostatic. On the other hand, while the water needs for drinking and cooking for a family of four people constitute approx. 20 l/day, operation of POU UF system under low flux conditions is possible. One of the most important limitations for application of ultrafiltration in simple household devices, is membrane fouling. In order to overcome the reasons of the limited application of UF in POU systems, the better understanding of the UF process in these specific conditions and specially membrane fouling is needed. Recent studies have shown that dissolved or colloidal polysaccharides and proteins and their interactions with the  membrane and between macromolecules might have more severe impact. During long term dead-end filtration, accumulation of the macromolecules on the membrane surface and increase of their concentration is severe. The interactions between those macromolecules in the conditions of high concentrations in the boundary layer affect the structure of the layer and its permeability. However, in most of the studies, only the foulant-membrane interactions are considered like relevant for reversibility of fouling. The foulant-foulant interactions in the boundary layer have been studied only superficially. Therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of polysaccharide and solution properties on UF membrane fouling in conditions of low flux and limited backflushing, under constant TMP conditions (hydrostatic pressure of 120 mbar - 150 mbar. Our experimental results lead us to the following conclusions: Regarding the initial stage of flux decline (0-80 ml permeate/cm2) the polysaccharide structure, and particularly availability of carboxyl groups, has a major impact on the membrane fouling, while the molecular weights of polysaccharides does not play a significant role (in the studied range of Mw 5-250 kDa). Such solution conditions as presence of metal ions and ionic  strength are also detrimental for the fouling, while both metal ions and ionic strength have impact on the gel structure and properties, generally stabilizing it, and increasing the possibility of water trapping by hydrogen bonding, which leads to the higher permeability. However, independently of the initial solution conditions, after approx. 80 ml has been filtered through 1 cm2 of the membrane, flux becomes stable on the level of approx. 10 L/(hm2) over the whole period of operation (several weeks in some cases). We suppose that the gel layer formed by polysaccharides play a role of a “second” membrane on the surface of the PES UF membrane, keeping remaining permeability on the certain level, determined by the water retention properties of the gel structure. Regarding practical application, the obtained results open a new direction for the ultrafiltration in specific conditions of household systems. The long term ultrafiltration should be studied on natural waters to prove the flux stabilization phenomenon. This phenomenon may give a possibility to produce up to 10 L/h of water from 1 m2 of the membrane applying only 120 mbar of hydrostatic pressure (1.2 m water level difference) without backflushing or crossflow, which may simplify the design and maintenance of the system and significantly reduce its costs.  Next activities in Techneau project will include the further evaluation of the long term ultrafiltration on natural waters; characterization of the impact of biofouling on the flux decline; and evaluation of the operational parameters of the Point-of-use system, based on the proposed above concept to treat at least 20 L/day.},

   abstract = {In Germany 35% of the total energy consumption in water utilities is due to well pumping (Plath et al., 2010). Therefore, a more efficient abstraction, besides the reduction of the carbon footprint, will lead to economic benefits for the operator. Different strategies exist for energy saving both in the operation of well fields as well as with the use of adapted, energy-efficient technical equipment (pumps, pipes, etc.) (Madsen et al., 2009). The objective of this study is the development and testing of a well field optimization tool, which is based on a hydraulic pipe network model (EPANET) but also takes steady-state well drawdown into account. The optimizer, based on coupling EPANET with the programing language R, simulates automatically the different optimization strategies (e.g. smart well field management, pump renewal) and evaluates their impact on the energy demand. The developed well field model was tested for a case study in France and predicted the measured energy demand with an error of less than 2%. The identified energy saving potential found by the optimizer reaches up to 17% in case of implementing only smart well field management and close to 50% combining the latter option with pump renewal.},

Da Starkregen in Deutschland in Zukunft häufiger auftreten wird, erscheint es sinnvoll, Methoden zu entwickeln, die, auch perspektivisch proaktiv, bei der Auswertung, Lokalisierung und Ausmaß von Ereignissen helfen können. Das Konzept, Social Media Daten zu nutzen, ist nicht neu. Es ist als „Crowdsourcing“ bekannt und wird bereits seit Jahren in vielen Bereichen eingesetzt. Es wurden insgesamt zwei Starkregenereignisse zur Untersuchung ausgewählt. Das erste Ereignis fand vom 29.06.2017 bis zum 30.06.2017 statt. Das zweite Ereignis ging vom 22.07.2017 bis zum 29.07.2107. Die Regenmengen der beiden Regenereignisse wurden mithilfe von Regenschreiberdaten der Stadt Berlin ausgewertet. Die Social Media Daten wurden von den Plattformen Facebook, Twitter, YouTube und Google gesammelt, entsprechenden Orten in Berlin zugeordnet und ausgewertet. Mit diesen Daten ließen sich Überflutungskarten erstellen. Hinzu kamen die Einsatzdaten der Berliner Feuerwehr im Rahmen dieser Ereignisse. Die anhand der Social Media Daten erhaltenen Überflutungsdaten wurden mit den Regenschreiberdaten und den Feuerwehreinsatzdaten abgeglichen und auf ihre Korrelationen untersucht. Die drei Datensätze für sich alleine genommen haben Vorteile und Nachteile ergänzen sich aber gegenseitig sehr gut. Bei einem Abgleich lässt sich dann ein Ereignis gut in seiner Länge und in seinem Ausmaß beschreiben. Die entwickelte Methode kann als direkter Überflutungsnachweis unter Beachtung von Einschränkungen, wie Bildqualität oder Zuordenbarkeit von Social Media Daten, dienen. Darüber hinaus bietet die Nutzung von Social Media Daten eine gute Ergänzung und Möglichkeit zur Validierung und Kalibrierung von Überflutungsmodellen.},

   title = {RKM - Getrennte Erfassung von  Röntgenkontrastmitteln - Zwischenbericht},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2004},
   abstract = {In Berliner Gewässern wurden hohen AOI-Konzentrationen nachgewiesen. Als Quelle für diese Jodfracht wurden die iodorganischen Röntgenkontrastmitteln (RKM) identifiziert, die zu 50% aus Krankenhäusern emittiert werden und zu 50% aus ambulante Praxen. Diese Jodverbindungen werden bis zu 98% über Urin innerhalb von 24h ausgeschieden. Sie werden in den Kläranlagen sehr wenig abgebaut (max. 8% in Berliner Kläranlagen). Bisher wurde keine Toxizität für RKM und deren Metaboliten nachgewiesen, jedoch sind noch nicht alle Effekte bekannt. Aufgrund des  Vorsorgeprinzips sollte der Eintrag von RKM in die Umwelt vermieden werden.  Seit April 2004 wird die Machbarkeit einer getrennten Erfassung von iodorganischen RKM durch das KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin und die GÖK Consulting AG in zwei Berliner Krankenhäuser (Universitätsklinikum Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum und Maria-Heimsuchung Caritas-Klinik Pankow) durchgeführt, mit Unterstützung der Berliner Wasserbetriebe. Ziel der dreizehnmonatigen ersten Phase ist es, geeignete Sanitärlösungen zu entwickeln und zu bewerten. Die Schlussfolgerungen werden als Basis für eine Entscheidung zur Durchführung einer Praxiphase dienen. In diesem Zwischenbericht werden die erste Ergebnisse der abgeschlossenen Arbeitspakete „Erfassung der Ausgangsdaten“ (AP 1.2), „Erarbeitung der Sanitärlösungen“ (AP 1.3) und „Sanitärtechnik“ (AP 1.4) zusammengefasst.  Es werden drei Sanitärlösungen erarbeitet: eine zentrale Lösung mit einer Trenntoilette in der Röntgenabteilung und Aufenthalt der Patienten vor Ort in den 4h nach der Untersuchung, eine dezentrale Lösung mit einer Trenntoilette auf den Stationen in den 24h nach der Untersuchung, und eine zweite dezentrale Lösung mit mobilen Urinbehältern (Urinflaschen, Steckbecken). Für diese dezentrale Lösungen wurden „Schwerpunktstationen“ identifiziert, mit einem hohen Anzahl an Patienten mit einer RKM-Untersuchung.  Um den Jodstofffluss zu berechnen, wurden in beiden beteiligten Krankenhäusern Daten zu RKM-Einkauf und RKM-Verbrauch erfasst. Abwasserdaten wurden anhand vorhandenen Analysen sowie weitere detaillierte Messkampagnen ermittelt. Im Rahmen einer ausführlichen Literaturrecherche wurden insbesondere Daten zur Ausscheidungsdauer von RKM erfasst.  Zusätzlich wurden Patientendaten erfasst (Zahlen, Aufschlüsselung zu den verschiedenen Geräte, Mobilität, Anzahl der Toilettengänge, Flüssigkeitsaufnahme). Anhand dieser Daten sowie weitere Gespräche mit den Mitarbeitern im Krankenhaus konnten die drei Sanitärlösungen erarbeitet werden.  Für die zentrale Lösung sind Wartebereiche erforderlich. Die vorhandene Räume wären jedoch in beiden Krankenhäusern ausgelastet, und der Umbau eines weiteres Aufenthaltbereiches wäre nur im grösseren Krankenhaus möglich. Zusätzlich sollte eine zusätzliche Betreuungskraft für die Patienten eingestellt werden, und die eventuelle Verweilzeitverlängerung sollte aufgrund der hohen Kosten vermieden werden. Die vorhandene Sanitäreinrichtungen, die mit einer Trenntoilette umgerüstet werden sollten, würden ausreichen. Vorteil dieser Lösung, sofern Wartebereiche eingerichtet werden können, wäre einen höheren Erfassungsgrad, da die stationäre Patienten aus zahlreichen Stationen herkommen. Der Verbleib in der Röntgenabteilung bis zu 4h nach der Untersuchung ist jedoch problematisch, und die Akzeptanz wird in einem weiteren Arbeitspaket näher untersucht.  Die dezentrale Varianten erweisen sich in beiden Krankenhäusern als leichter umsetzbar. Es sind keine Warteräume erforderlich und die Betreuung der Patienten könnte durch das vorhandene Personal übernommen werden. Dadurch werden in der Röntgenabteilung keine Veränderungen (ausser die Identifizierung als ‚RKM-Patient’) verursacht, und auf der Stationen stellt die Integration im Behandlungsablauf keine besondere Hindernisse dar (ausser dem Laufweg für die Lösung mit Trenntoilette und der Benutzung von Urinbehältern für die zweite Lösung) Die erforderliche Räumlichkeiten auf den Schwerpunktstationen wurden untersucht. Fur die erste dezentrale Variante könnte die Trenntoilette nicht in den wenigen vorhandenen Toiletten eingebaut werden, jedoch bietet es sich an, in einem vorhandenen Bad die Toilette einzubauen. Für die zweite Variante könnten die Urinflaschen bzw. Steckbecken in einem Spülautomat entleert werden, der in einem vorhandenen Unreinraum eingebaut sein kann.   Die Erfassungsmenge von Jod, der durch den Einsatz der jeweiligen Sanitärlösungen erfasst würde, wurde anhand der absoluten Erfassungsmenge im Vergleich zur applizierten Jodmenge im gesamten Krankenhaus ermittelt. Der Erfassungsgrad ist relativ niedrig. Patienten sind nämlich auf vielen Stationen verteilt, so dass die Erfassung nur auf Schwerpunktstationen die Erfassungsmenge reduziert. Zusätzlich werden in anderen Abteilungen Jod verabreicht, so dass der Verbrauch der Radiologie nur einen Anteil der gesamten Menge darstellt.  Zum Auswahl einer Trenntoilette wurden Informationen von Herstellern in Deutschland sowie andere Projekte zur getrennten Urinerfassung im Haushalt geholt. Die wichtigste Kriterien sind die Hygiene und die Möglichkeit, Urin unverdünnt zu sammeln. Aus dieser Gründe wird die Schwerkrafttrenntoilette ‚No-Mix-Toilet’ der Firma Roediger empfohlen.  Zur Bewertung der erarbeiteten Lösungen wurde eine systematische Nutzwertanalyse durchgeführt. Dabei wurden die folgende Kriterien berücksichtigt: Räumlichkeiten (vorhandene Sanitärtechnik und Wartebereiche), zusätzliche Betreuungsaufwand, Integration im Behandlungsablauf in der Radiologie und auf der Station, Qualität der Patientenbehandlung (subjektives Gefühl), absolute Erfassungsmenge und Erfassungsgrad.  Diese erste Bewertung zeigte, dass die dezentrale Lösungen in beiden Krankenhäusern bevorzugt werden. Die dezentrale Lösung mit Urinbehälter wird als beste Variante eingestuft und die dezentrale Lösung mit Trenntoiletten als mittlere Lösung. Die zentrale Lösung wird deutlich in beiden Krankenhäusern als weniger geeignet eingeschätzt.  Die Kriterien Wirtschaftlichkeit, Akzeptanz und Urinentsorgung konnten noch nicht berücksichtigt werden. Erst nach der Erarbeitung der entsprechenden Arbeitspakete, die bis April 2005 laufen, wird eine vollständige Bewertung möglich, die zur Entscheidung für die Durchführung einer Praxisphase führen soll.},

   abstract = {In Berliner Gewässern wurden hohe AOI-Konzentrationen nachgewiesen, die auf den Eintrag von iodorganischen Röntgenkontrastmitteln (RKM) zurückzuführen sind. RKM werden bei Röntgenuntersuchungen in Krankenhäusern und in niedergelassenen Praxen jeweils zu 50% verabreicht und innerhalb von 24h über den Urin quasi vollständig ausgeschieden. Diese schlecht abbaubaren Stoffe werden in den Kläranlagen nicht eliminiert und gelangen in die Umwelt. Aufgrund des Vorsorgeprinzips und des Minimierungsgebotes für sauberes Trinkwasser bietet es sich an, die RKM an der Quelle zurückzuhalten. Es wurden drei Erfassungskonzepte entwickelt und systematisch bewertet, um den mit RKM belasteten Urin in Krankenhäusern getrennt zu sammeln und zu entsorgen. Diese Machbarkeitsstudie wurde vom April 2004 bis April 2005 vom KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin durchgeführt, in Zusammenarbeit mit der GÖK Consulting AG, den Berliner Wasserbetrieben und zwei Berliner Krankenhäusern, die beispielhaft für das Krankenhauswesen in Deutschland stehen: das Universitätsklinikum Charité - Campus Virchow-Klinikum (CVK) und die Maria Heimsuchung Caritas-Klinik Pankow.  Das erste Erfassungskonzept ist die zentrale Sammlung in der Radiologie mit einer Trenntoilette in den ersten 4h nach der Röntgenuntersuchung. Jedoch ist dieses Erfassungskonzept mit einem hohen Personalaufwand und entsprechenden Kosten verbunden. Die Wartezeit stellt aufgrund der erforderlichen Räumlichkeiten und der Qualität der Patientenbehandlung ein wesentliches Hindernis dar. Weiterhin ergab die Stoffstromanalyse, dass innerhalb der Punktquelle Krankenhaus eine Vielzahl an Verbrauchs- und somit Emissionsquellen vorhanden sein können. In der Charité-CVK stellt die Radiologie nur ein Drittel des Verbrauchs im Krankenhaus, so dass bei zentraler Erfassung an dieser Stelle nur ein geringer Erfassungsgrad erreicht wird.  Die dezentrale Sammlung stellt eine Alternative dar, um den Urin der Patienten 24h nach der Röntgenuntersuchung zu sammeln, in den Stationen mit einer hohen Anzahl an „RKMPatienten“. Ein erstes dezentrales Konzept ist die Sammlung mit einer Trenntoilette, die beispielsweise in dem Stationsbad eingebaut werden kann. Dadurch wird der Behandlungsablauf wenig verändert und der Personalaufwand ist relativ niedrig, jedoch kann nur der Urin der mobilen Patienten gesammelt werden, so dass der Erfassungsgrad niedrig ist. Weiterhin ist die Umsetzung in weiteren Stationen aufgrund der aufwendigen Umbaumaßnahmen schwierig. Alternativ könnte die Sammlung mit mobilen Urinbehältern erfolgen. Bei diesem zweiten dezentralen Erfassungskonzept ist eine Urinsammlung 24h nach der Röntgenuntersuchung vorgesehen, anhand von Urinflaschen bzw. Steckbecken für die bettlägerigen Patienten sowie Sammelurinbehältern für mobile Patienten. Diese Behälter werden dann vom Stationspersonal in grösseren Behältern in den vorhandenen Unreinräumen gesammelt. Die Sammelbehälter werden vom Reinigungsdienst zur externen Entsorgung bereitgestellt. Neben der Urinaufbereitung und den Möglichkeiten der Iodrückgewinnung aus dem mit RKM belasteten Urin, die im Rahmen von Forschungsprojekten bereits untersucht werden, könnten die Iodverbindungen in Sonderabfallverbrennungsanlagen eliminiert werden. Durch das dezentrale Erfassungskonzept mit mobilen Behältern kann eine höhere Iodmenge gesammelt werden, verbunden mit einem geringen Personalaufwand und wenigen organisatorischen Änderungen. Dieses Konzept beruht auf einfachen Sammlungswegen, die bereits in den Krankenhäusern angewendet werden und ohne erheblichen Aufwand in vielen Bereichen umgesetzt werden könnten. Unter den drei entwickelten Erfassungskonzepten, stellt also die dezentrale Sammlung mit mobilen Behältern die einzige praktikable Möglichkeit dar, um eine getrennte Erfassung umfassend umsetzen},

   abstract = {Cyanobacteria proliferation and the potential health risk related with the release of the associated toxins have lead the local association EDEN to initiate a comprehensive study on cyanobacteria in the river Erdre. Within the consortium in charge of the project, the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB) realised lab-scale research in cooperation with the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), on the species Planktothrix agardhii which predominates in the river Erdre, and the associated toxin microcystin. The objective was to determine the influence of key factors such as nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), light, flow velocity and sediments on cyanobacteria growth and competition as well as microcystin release from the Planktothrix population in the river Erdre. Results from the lab-scale cultures proved that nutrient-limited conditions lead to a decrease of cyanobacteria biomass and may favour some genotypes with reduced needs among the Planktothrix population. Given the current state of scientific knowledge, no differences in competition between toxic and non-toxic Planktothrix strains can be established. Nutrient limitation favours microcystin release from cells, however the global decrease of cyanobacteria biomass induces a decrease of the total quantity of released toxin. These results can be applied in a water body where nutrients concentrations are very low (below 50 µg/L for total phosphorus). In the river Erdre, as long as external nutrients inputs remain considerable, light is the limiting factor. Internal nutrient recycling from the sediments is globally negligible in comparison with external inputs. Culture experiments in a flow simulation flume proved that flow velocity had substantial impact neither on Planktothrix growth nor on microcystin release. Only a short transition phase with negative effects was observed. Overwintering of Planktothrix in Erdre-sediments could be proved by the detection of a substantial population using fluorescence analysis. This inoculum should be large enough for initiation of Planktothrix development in the next vegetation period. However, the high adsorption capacities of the analysed sediments from the river Erdre allow to put aside a potential risk of microcystin release from sludge. While providing innovative results on the species Planktothrix agardhii, this project contributes to the comprehensive study initiated by the EDEN association in order to preserve the values associated with environment, health and tourism in the river Erdre.},

   abstract = {The study “Trace pollutants in combined sewer overflows” provides an overview on the input of trace substances (organic or inorganic trace substances) to surface waters during combined sewer overflows (CSO). The study outlines substance pathways, types of substances, expected loads as well as possible impacts on the receiving water. The study shall aid the discussion and further handling of trace substances within the project Monitor-1, which is currently carried out at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB). The study has identified more than 300 substances, which could reach the Berlin surface water bodies via CSO. Moreover, it is assumed that there is a large number of substances and metabolites, which are still unknown. Sewage-related substances in combined sewers can stem from:  household products (e.g. surfactants from cleaning agents),  leaching (e.g. amines from textile colours or Bisphenol A from plastic coatings), wash-off of cosmetic products (e.g. Benzophenone-3 from sunblocks) or health lotions, excretion of ingested products (e.g. the pain killer Diclofenac). Stormwater-related substances in combined sewers can stem from abrasion from car and railway traffic (e.g. cadmium from break lining abrasion), erosion of building materials (e.g. copper from eaves gutters), application (e.g. glyphosate for weed control on pavements) or atmospheric deposition (e.g. polychlorinated dibenzofurans from exhaust fumes). In the framework of this study available substance data was assembled, containing: general information like synonyms and CAS-No., chemical properties, elimination rate in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), observed concentrations in surface waters and toxicity. A complete list of the substances as well as selected substance properties is attached in table A6 (Appendix). Some of these substances can be used as tracers to distinguish different pollution pathways to surface waters. Suitable indicators should enter surface waters mainly via one pathway, their half-life in surface waters should be sufficiently long, concentrations should show no seasonal fluctuations and they should be well-measurable. For instance, caffeine is a good indicator for inflows of untreated sewage via CSO, as it is very well degraded in WWTP. As an indicator for treated sewage the almost nondegradable anti-epileptic Carbamazepine could be used. Finally, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) could be used as indicator for stormwater-related pollution. In road traffic, PAHs result from incomplete combustion processes, adsorb on atmospheric particles, deposit on the surface and are washed off by rainfall runoff. In this study the relevance of the path “CSO” for trace substance emissions from the Berlin wastewater system in comparison to the other paths (storm drainage and WWTP) was assessed. Therefore, a simple balance of the fraction of CSO in total emissions to the Berlin surface waters was carried out. The balance was based on the annual volumes of WWTP effluents, storm drainage and CSO. Due to a lack in substancespecific measurement information the balance was calculated dependent on the elimination rate of substances in WWTPs. Based on the resulting figures A, B, C, D and E the fraction of CSO in total loads to the Berlin surface waters can be assessed for each substance with known elimination rate in WWTPs. In the study we distinguished between: (i) sewage related substances / stormwater related substances, (ii) balance area „Berlin total“ (5 WWTPs with 622,000 m³/d, 97 km2 combined sewer system, 231 km2 storm drainage system) / balance area „Berlin city centre“ (60% of the WWTP Münchehofe with 39,000 m³/d, 83 km2 combined sewer system, 112 km2 storm drainage system) and (iii) total annual loads / event based loads.},

   abstract = {Aufgrund einer unzureichenden Spurenstoffelimination in der konventionellen Abwasserbehandlung, bilden Klärwerke einen wichtigen Eintragspfad anthropogener organischer Spurenstoffe in Oberflächengewässer. Zum Abbau der Belastung durch organische Spurenstoffe im Klarlauf rüsten nach und nach Klärwerke mit einer vierten Reinigungsstufe auf. Dabei wird zur Entfernung der Spurenstoffe auf Aktivkohle oder Ozonung zurückgegriffen. Für die entsprechenden Modifikationen der Klärwerke werden zuvor häufig aufwendige Pilotuntersuchungen durchgeführt, um die entsprechenden Prozessparameter für die Auslegung zu bestimmen. Um diesen Prozess zu umgehen und die damit entstehenden Mehrkosten und Arbeitskräfte zu reduzieren oder gar einzusparen, sollten Pilotierungen durch schnelle, aussagekräftige Experimente im Labormaßstab ausgewechselt werden. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde eine Testmethode zu der Ozonung durchgeführt und der Einfluss der Zugabeart, der Temperatur, der Wassermatrix und des Gehalts an DOC und Nitrit untersucht. Für die Validierung der Simulationsumgebung und der Vorhersage des Spurenstoffabbaus in Abhängigkeit von den Einflussfaktoren wurden entsprechende Versuche in dem Institut für Wasserreinhaltung an der Technischen Universität Berlin durchgeführt. Die Testmethoden eines Batch-Verfahrens, bei der eine variierende Menge an hochkonzentrierter Ozonlösung in dem konstant gehaltenen Probevolumen gegeben wird, wurde mit der indirekten Messung der Ozonexposition durch Indigo (DIN 38408-3) gekoppelt und verschiedenen Variationen der Einflussparameter ausgesetzt. Neben der Indigomessmethode wurde auch die Alternative mit Nitritquench ausprobiert und festgestellt, dass diese sich dafür nicht eignet. Durch das Testen der Zugabeart konnte festgestellt werden, dass eine 1: 2 Dosierung einer 2-Punktinjektion am effektivsten für die Elimination der meisten Spurenstoffe ist. Des Weiteren führte eine Variation der Probentemperatur bei Batch-Versuchen zu einer Senkung der Ozonexposition und zu keinen nennenswerten Einflüssen auf die Spurenstoffelimination. Drei Kläranlagenabläufe aus unterschiedlichen Regionen Deutschlands mit unterschiedlichen pH-Werten, DOC- und Nitritkonzentrationen wurden verglichen. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass die Korrektur des Ozoneintrags um einen Nitritfaktor und der Bezug auf den DOC zwar ein gutes Instrument darstellen, um unterschiedliche Wassermatrizen vergleichbar zu machen, jedoch nicht ganz ausreichend ist. Während die Kläranlagenabläufe ähnliche Ergebnisse der Spurenstoffelimination bei der Auftragung über SAK254 liefern, wurden bei der Auftragung von Spurenstoffs Abbau über EDOC,korr einige Diskrepanzen festgestellt, die nicht durch eine pH-Wert Korrektur wettgemacht werden konnten. Analog sah die Situation auch bei der Ozonexposition aus. Dies lässt sich durch die verschiedene Zusammensetzung des organischen Materials und der Menge an als Radikalfänger agierenden Stoffen im Kläranlagenablauf erklären. Nichtsdestotrotz erwies sich ein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen dem delta SAK254 und der Elimination jeden Spurenstoffes, der als ein robustes Instrument zu der zu erwartenden Entfernung bei einem bestimmten Ozoneintrag verwendet werden kann, allerdings nur, wenn pH-Wert ebenfalls mitberücksichtigt wird. Zur Vorhersage der Spurenstoffelimination wurden auch die theoretischen möglichen OHRadikalexpositionen aus den Ozonexpositionen berechnet. Dabei ergaben sich bei allen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten sehr große Varianzen, von denen keine den realen Messwert getroffen hat.},

   abstract = {Being a measure to counteract an increasing water scarcity in multiple regions of the world, water reuse is the subject of numerous investigations. The pan-European project DEMOWARE aims at tackling barriers related to water reuse to support further applications. At the project site of Braunschweig in Germany wastewater is reused historically to irrigate agricultural fields. Against the background of an ongoing debate in Germany to establish a legal basis for water reuse, options for a disinfection of secondary treated wastewater were tested at the wastewater treatment plant Steinhof. This thesis investigates the disinfection performance of two pilot scale plants (performic acid (PFA) dosage and UV irradiation) against the background of the compliance with wastewater-related standards, especially DIN 19650 and a WHO guideline regarding wastewater reuse. In order to meet recommendations of the latter, a noro- and rotavirus removal of 1.5 log was recommended by (1) for the site of Braunschweig. E. coli, intestinal enterococci (IE) and Clostridium perfringens were analyzed regarding their abundance and log removal concerning physicochemical properties. Serving as indicator organisms, they were related to the log removal of noro- and rotavirus. Differing doses were tested. The impact of the contact time was investigated for PFA by the presence or absence of sodium thiosulfate (STS) in the sampling bottles whereat the presence of STS terminates the disinfection process. The application of STS in the PFA sampling bottles caused a performance difference of 1.32 log for E. coli, 0.78 log for IE and 0.28 log for C. perfringens. Hence, the PFA reaction was not completed at the effluent sampling spot of the reactor (stirrer tank) and the determined minimum contact time of 3.5 min is not sufficient for PFA to develop its complete disinfection performance. The disinfection reactor did not provide the minimum recommended RT (10 min). Possibly, short circuits and zones with limited substance exchange occur. For full scale implementations, the PFA contact basins need to be designed carefully. A flow channel as used at full scale reference applications is preferable here. The PFA plant showed break-ins of the disinfection performance (to values < 0.5 log) for definable and indefinable reasons. Hence, its disinfection performance is not constant. Further investigations are necessary. Of the 3 doses per method deployed, a UV dose of 44 Wh/m³ and a PFA dose of 2 ppm (≥ 10 min, without STS) is proper to achieve quality class 3 of the DIN 19650 which is required for the present conditions and applications in Braunschweig. The requirements for a noro- and rotavirus removal of 1.5 log units according to the WHO guideline can be satisfied by a dose of 2 ppm of PFA and 35 Wh/m³, respectively, using an evaluation based on the mean value of the disinfection performance (both PFA and UV). By the application of a threshold-based evaluation the requirements are not satisfied for UV irradiation. Regarding PFA dosing, a dose of 2 ppm is sufficient as long as a sufficient contact time (≥ 10 min) is provided. The order of sensitivity against the disinfection methods was found for both UV irradiation and PFA dosage the same: E. coli > E. cocci > C. perfringens. Clostridium being used as an indicator for endospore-formers showed a remarkably lower sensitivity against both methods. A doseperformance-linearity can be suggested for the present range of dosage for E. coli and IE. C. perfringens does not show a correlation between the PFA/UV dose and the disinfection performance.},

   abstract = {The present study analyses the environmental footprint of the Braunschweig wastewater scheme using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment. All relevant processes of wastewater treatment and disposal are modelled in a substance flow model based on available full-scale data (year 2010) complemented by literature data to calculate aggregated emissions and resource demand of the system. Products of the system (i.e. electricity from biogas combustion, nutrients, and irrigation water) are accounted with credits for the respective substituted products. Beside the status quo of the Braunschweig system in 2010, a set of optimisation scenarios are assessed in their effects on the environmental footprint which target an enhanced recovery of energy and nutrients. The scenarios include the addition of different co-substrates, thermal hydrolysis of sludge in various configurations, nutrient recovery for nitrogen and phosphorus, and utilization of excess heat via an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The energetic balance of the system is comparatively good, as 79% of the cumulative energy demand can be offset by secondary products, mainly biogas (58%) and fertilizer substitution (14%). The optimisation of nutrient and especially water management offers considerable potential for improving the energy balance, the latter due to the high demand of electricity for pumping the water to the fields. The net carbon footprint of the system amounts to 10 kg CO2-eq/(PECOD*a) and is mainly caused by energy-related processes, augmented by direct emissions of N2O and CH4 in the activated sludge process. Nutrient emissions in surface waters are relatively low (29 g P and 80 g N/(PECOD*a)) due to the transfer of nutrients to agriculture and the polishing effect of the infiltration fields. While effects on human toxicity are small after normalisation to German conditions, Cu and Zn emissions to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems lead to a substantial impact in ecotoxicity (organic substances not accounted). Normalisation of the environmental footprint reveals the primary function of the wastewater treatment plant, i.e. the protection of surface waters from inorganic and organic pollutants and excessive nutrient input. Whereas the quantitative contribution of the system is high for eutrophication and ecotoxicity, energy consumption and correlated indicators such as carbon footprint, acidification and human toxicity have only a minor share to the total environmental impacts per inhabitants in Germany. Consequently, the optimisation of the latter environmental impacts should only be pursued if the primary function of the sewage treatment and related impacts on surface waters are not compromised by these measures. In scenario analysis, both the addition of co-substrates and the thermal hydrolysis of sludge for improving the anaerobic degradation into biogas have a substantial positive effect on the energy balance and carbon footprint without impairing other environmental impacts. Based on the results of the pilot trials in CoDiGreen, the current energy demand can be reduced up to 80% by a combination of adding ensiled grass into the digestor and hydrolysis of excess sludge (potentials have to be verified in full-scale trials). A twostep digestion process with intermediate dewatering and hydrolysis (DLD configuration with EXELYS™) seems promising in terms of energy benefits and carbon footprint. The recovery of nitrogen or phosphorus from the sludge liquor of dewatering does not result in major benefits in the environmental profile, whereas the implementation of an ORC process for energy recovery from excess heat can be fully recommended from an environmental point of view.},

   abstract = {The goal of this study is to demonstrate the application of Life Cycle Assessment as a tool for systems analysis in wastewater treatment. Therefore, the process for sludge treatment and disposal at the WWTP Berlin-Waßmannsdorf has been analysed with the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the total cumulative energy demand and the carbon footprint of the system as exemplary indicators. In addition to the characterization of the status quo in 2009, several measures for an energetic optimization of the system have been evaluated in their effects on the energy balance and greenhouse gas emissions. The process model of the system encompasses all relevant processes of sludge treatment and disposal, including the supply of electricity and chemicals, transport and incineration of the sludge, and treatment of sludge liquor which is recycled back to the WWTP inlet. Products recovered during sludge treatment (biogas from anaerobic digestion and MAP fertilizer) and disposal in incineration (electricity or substitution of fossil fuels) are accounted by credits for the respective substituted products. Overall, sludge treatment and disposal in Berlin-Waßmannsdorf is an energy-positive process, recovering a net amount of primary energy of 162 MJ (45 kWh) per population equivalent and year (PECOD*a). This is mainly due to the biogas generated in anaerobic digestion and the substitution of fossil fuels in co-incineration. Similarly, the carbon footprint of the process reveals an amount of 11.6 kg CO2-eq/(PECOD*a) as avoided emissions, thus indicating the environmental benefits of energy recovery from sewage sludge. However, process emissions of the powerful greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O are estimated based on generic emission factors from literature, and can have a distinct influence on the overall carbon footprint. This underlines the necessity to support the results of this LCA with primary data from monitoring of emissions on-site. The evaluation of optimization measures shows the benefits of a system-wide analysis: an enhanced recovery of energy is partially offset by increased energy demand, and the carbon footprint does not always correlate with the energy balance. The different routes for sludge disposal differ heavily in their environmental profile and show potentials for optimisation, especially in mono-incineration of sewage sludge. Some measures are beneficial for both energy and carbon footprint (addition of co-substrates into the digestor, utilization of excess heat with an Organic Rankine Cycle process), while others can decrease energy demand but may potentially increase the carbon footprint (treatment of sludge liquor by deammonification, thermal hydrolysis of excess sludge). Overall, the method of Life Cycle Assessment proved to be well suited for a systematic analysis of the environmental footprint of the activities of Berliner Wasserbetriebe. In the future, the existing process model can be extended to include the entire wastewater treatment plant for a comprehensive evaluation of its environmental profile, e.g. for providing information on the environmental consequences of prospective concepts for site development.},

   abstract = {For a future upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Ruhleben targeting advanced removal of total phosphorus (TP) (< 50-120 µg/L TP) and seasonal disinfection, various technological options for tertiary treatment of secondary effluent are suitable to fulfill these goals. This study applies the holistic methods of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to assess and compare those options for tertiary treatment at WWTP Ruhleben in their environmental and economic impacts, including all relevant direct and indirect processes and effects of the WWTP upgrade. Options for tertiary treatment include gravity-driven processess such as dual media filtration (DMF), microsieve filtration (MSF), or high-rate sedimentation (HRS), and membrane-based processes such as ultrafiltration with polymer membranes (Polymer UF) or microfiltration with ceramic membranes (Ceramic MF). For disinfection in the summer period, gravity-driven processes are complemented by downstream UV disinfection, which is only applied in rain weather bypass for membrane processes. Process data for operational parameters and infrastructure design are based on longterm pilot trials at technical scale (DMF, MSF, Polymer UF, Ceramic MF) or process modelling based on supplier information (HRS). LCA shows that the existing phosphorus load in secondary effluent of WWTP Ruhleben (28 t/a TP) can be reduced substantially by all processes, eliminating 19-25 t/a TP (6790%) depending on the process. A minor side-benefit for effluent quality is also expected from the further elimination of heavy metals adsorbed to particulate matter in secondary effluent. At the same time, tertiary treatment schemes will increase energy demand and related emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon footprint) of the existing WWTP process by an estimated 12-21% and 7-13%, respectively. Gravity-driven processes with low coagulant dosing (DMF, MSF, HRS) have a considerably lower energy demand and carbon footprint than membrane-based processes with high electricity demand for feed pumps and higher coagulant dose. At the same time, low-energy treatment processes do not reach the exceptional high effluent quality of membrane-based processes. Consequently, a certain trade-off between energy demand/carbon footprint and effluent quality can be quantified. In analogy to the environmental assessment and effluent quality, LCC results show that total annual costs are lowest for HRS (5.1 Mio €/a) and comparable between DMF and MSF (5.7 Mio €/a), followed by Polymer UF (10.2 Mio €/a) and Ceramic MF (12.2 Mio €/a). In comparison to gravity-driven processes, membrane-based processes are characterized by both higher investment costs (factor 1.5 – 3x) and higher operational costs (factor 2 – 2.5x), mainly due to high costs of membranes, machinery, electricity, and coagulants. Comparing the relative resource efficiency for selected environmental and economic parameters related to the total load of eliminated phosphorus, DMF and MSF are the most efficient of the assessed technologies for tertiary treatment, spending ~ 250 €/kg Pelim and causing 180 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim (both with UV disinfection as post-treatment). HRS + UV has higher relative costs (270 €/kg Pelim) and higher carbon footprint (235 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim) due to the lower effluent quality of the process (= less reduction in TP loads). Membrane-based processes have the highest relative costs for P removal (400475 €/kg Pelim) and the highest carbon footprint (275 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim): even though their superior effluent quality leads to the highest total reduction in TP loads, the high energy demand and costs of membrane processes yield higher relative spending of resources related to the final goal.

   abstract = {For improved exploitation of the energy content present in the organic matter of raw sewage, an innovative concept for treatment of municipal wastewater is tested in pilot trials and assessed in energy balance and operational costs. The concept is based on a maximum extraction of organic matter into the sludge via coagulation, flocculation and microsieving (100 μm mesh size) to increase the energy recovery in anaerobic sludge digestion and decrease aeration demand for carbon mineralisation. Pilot trials with real wastewater yield an extraction of 70–80% of total chemical oxygen demand into the sludge while dosing 15–20 mg/L Al and 5–7 mg/L polymer with stable operation of the microsieve and effluent limits below 2–3 mg/L total phosphorus. Anaerobic digestion of the microsieve sludge results in high biogas yields of 600 NL/kg organic dry matter input (oDMin) compared to 430 NL/kg oDMin for mixed sludge from a conventional activated sludge process. The overall energy balance for a 100,000 population equivalent (PE) treatment plant (including biofilter for post-treatment with full nitrification and denitrification with external carbon source) shows that the new concept is an energy-positive treatment process with comparable effluent quality than conventional processes, even when including energy demand for chemicals production. Estimated operating costs for electricity and chemicals are in the same range for conventional activated sludge processes and the new concept.},

   abstract = {This study analyses reference and innovative POWERSTEP schemes for municipal WWTP in their environmental and economic impacts using life-cycle tools of Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing. Based on hypothetical scenarios at defined boundary conditions for WWTP size, influent quality, and effluent discharge limits, multiple process schemes have been modelled in a mass and energy flow model with a benchmarking software for WWTPs. This process data forms the basis to calculate operational efforts, and it is amended by infrastructure data for material demand and related investment costs. In addition, specific data has been added based on results of the POWERSTEP project (e.g. for N2O emissions) or information from literature. The results show that innovative schemes with advanced primary treatment operate with a superior electricity balance compared to current state-of-the-art schemes for municipal wastewater treatment as a reference, increasing electrical self-sufficiency from 27-82% to 80-170%. The POWERSTEP schemes reach this goal without compromising effluent quality targets of the schemes, i.e. reaching the same effluent quality than before. Concentrated influent with high COD levels supports the POWERSTEP approach and enables highly energy efficient schemes. However, nitrogen removal has to be realized with mainstream anammox after enhanced carbon extraction from concentrated influent. This process is still under development, and its performance and stability should be further validated in full-scale references. Sidestream N removal, advanced control of COD extraction and partial bypass of primary treatment are other options to guarantee nitrogen removal after enhanced carbon extraction with conventional denitrification. In the life-cycle perspective, POWERSTEP schemes significantly decrease primary energy demand of WWTP operation by 29-134% compared to the reference. In favourable conditions, their superior electricity balance can fully compensate life-cycle energy demand for chemical production, sludge disposal and infrastructure, resulting in real energy-positive WWTP schemes. Greenhouse gas emissions can also be substantially reduced with POWERSTEP (- 6 to 43%) due to savings in grid electricity production. GHG benefits of POWERSTEP are smaller than energy benefits on a relative scale, because direct emissions such as N2O from biological N removal and mono-incineration also deliver a major contribution to overall GHG emission profiles, and they are not reduced with POWERSTEP. In contrast, POWERSTEP schemes with mainstream anammox will most likely increase N2O emissions, compensating a large part of the electricity-related benefits in GHG emissions. Total annual costs are in a comparable range for both reference and POWERSTEP schemes. While the latter decrease operational costs by 3-16% due to lower purchase of grid electricity, they require higher investment for primary treatment, increasing capital costs by 4-17%. Overall, effects of POWERSTEP on operational and capital costs off-set each other and result in a net increase of total annual costs of 2-7%, which is within the uncertainty range of this cost calculation. Higher electricity prices (> 0.12 €/kWh) will increase the positive impact of POWERSTEP on operating costs, resulting in fully costcompetitive eco-efficient WWTP schemes at power prices of 0.25 €/kWh. Final recommendations are derived on the way to develop eco-efficient WWTP schemes of the future.},

   abstract = {The recovery of phosphorus (P) from sewage sludge, sludge liquor, or ash from monoincineration can be realized with different processes which have been developed, tested or already realized in full-scale in recent years. However, these pathways and processes differ in their amount of P that can be recovered in relation to the total P content in sludge, in the quality of the recovered P product, and in their efforts in energy, chemicals, fuels, and infrastructure required for P recovery. This study analyses selected processes for P recovery from sludge, liquor, or ash in their potential environmental impacts, following the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, ISO 14040/44). Based on available process data from technology providers and end users, these processes are implemented in a hypothetical reference system for sludge digestion, dewatering and disposal in mono-incineration, including potential side-effects on mainstream wastewater treatment with the return load from sludge dewatering. Recovered products (e.g. P or N fertilizer, electricity, district heating) are accounted as credits for substituting equivalent industrial products. Depending on the maturity of the investigated process, collected process data of process efficiency, product quality, and energy and material demand originates from full-scale plants, pilot trials, or prospective modeling (status in 2014). This data is validated with the technology providers, transferred to the reference system and evaluated with a set of environmental indicators for energy demand, global warming, acidification, abiotic resource depletion, eutrophication, and human and ecotoxicity. Results show that pathways and processes for P recovery differ heavily in their amount of recovered P, but also in energy and related environmental impacts (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions). As direct struvite precipitation in sludge or liquor relies on the dissolved amount of P in digested sludge, these processes are only applicable in wastewater treatment plants with biological P removal. Here, they can recover 4-18% of total P in sludge with a relatively low effort in energy and chemicals, reducing return load to the mainstream process and eventually improving sludge dewaterability in case of direct precipitation in sludge. Acidic leaching of P from digested sludge can yield up to 48% of P for recovery, but requires a significant amount of chemicals for control of pH (leaching and precipitation) and for minimizing heavy metal transfer into the product. The quality of products from sludge and liquor is good with low content on heavy metals, leading to a low potential toxicity for humans and ecosystems. Leaching of monoincineration ash with sulphuric acid yields 70% P with moderate chemical demand, but the leached ash and co-precipitated materials have to be disposed, and the product contains some heavy metals. Complete digestion of ash in phosphoric acid and multi-stage cleaning with ion exchangers yields high recovery of 97% P in a high-quality product (H3PO4) and several coproducts, having an overall low environmental impact. Thermo-chemical treatment of ash can recover up to 98% P with moderate energy input in case of integration into an existing monoincineration facility, but the product still contains high amounts of selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn). Metallurgic treatment of dried sludge or ash can also recover up to 81% of P, but the process has still to be tested in continuous pilot trials to validate product quality, energy demand, and energy recovery options. Sensitivity analysis shows that other pathways of sludge disposal (e.g. co-incineration combined with upstream P extraction, direct application in agriculture) may also be reasonable from an environmental point of view depending on local boundary conditions and political targets. In general, the use of life-cycle based tools is strongly recommended to evaluate and select suitable strategies for regional or national concepts of P recovery from sewage sludge.},

   abstract = {Das Forschungsprojekt CoDiGreen (2010-2012) zielt auf eine Optimierung der Rückgewinnung von Energie und Nährstoffen in der Abwasserbehandlung in Braunschweig und Berlin. Dafür werden in Pilotversuchen die Auswirkungen einer Zugabe von Co-Substraten (Grassilage, Topinambur) und einer thermischen Druckhydrolyse des Überschussschlamms auf den Biogasertrag der Faulung untersucht. Zusätzlich wird die Co-Vergärung von Grassilage im großtechnischen Maßstab in einem Faulturm des Klärwerks Braunschweig-Steinhof getestet. Neben dem experimentellen Teil wird über eine Ökobilanz der ökologische Fußabdruck des Abwassersystems in Braunschweig und der Schlammbehandlung im Klärwerk Berlin-Wassmannsdorf analysiert, um Optimierungspotential zu erfassen und anhand ausgewählter Szenarien zu bewerten. Abschließend werden vergleichbare Konzepte der landwirtschaftlichen Wiederverwendung von Klarwasser und Schlamm in einer Marktstudie ermittelt und über eine Risikobewertung potentielle Gefahren dieses Systems identifiziert. Die Pilotversuche zeigen, dass sowohl die Zugabe von Co-Substraten als auch die thermische Hydrolyse einen substantiellen Gewinn an Biogasmenge und –qualität (CH4Gehalt) in einer mesophilen Faulung (Verweilzeit: 20d) ermöglichen kann. Die Methanerträge können um 10%, 9% und 13% durch thermische Hydrolyse von Überschussschlamm, Zugabe von Grassilage (+10% FS) und eine Kombination beider Maßnahmen gesteigert werden (sofern der Methanertrag lediglich auf den oTR des zugeführten Schlamms bezogen wird, betrug die Steigerung 10%, 31% und 38%). Eine zweistufige Faulung mit zwischengeschalteter Hydrolyse („DLD“) erbringt +19% CH4. Für anorganische und organische Schadstoffe werden dabei vorgeschriebene Grenzwerte der aktuellen Klärschlammverordnung nicht überschritten. Weiter zeigen Laboranalysen einen positiven Effekt auf die Entwässerbarkeit des Schlamms und den Bedarf an Polymeren. Leider können die vielversprechenden Ergebnisse der Co-Vergärung mit Gras in der Großtechnik nicht bestätigt werden. Für eine großtechnische Realisierung einer Co-Vergärung lässt sich abschätzen, dass für 100.000 EW ca. 30 ha extensiv bewirtschafteter Fläche erforderlich sind, um 10% oTR an Gras in Bezug zum oTR des Rohschlamms zu erzeugen. Leider können die vielversprechenden Ergebnisse der Co-Vergärung mit Gras in der Großtechnik nicht bestätigt werden, in der nur -8% Biogasertrag gemessen werden (+2% wenn der Methanertrag lediglich auf den oTR des zugeführten Schlamms bezogen wird). Obwohl die technische Machbarkeit der Graszugabe gezeigt werden kann, scheinen betriebliche Probleme (Größe der Fasern, hydraulische Durchmischung, niedrige Verweilzeit) die Umsetzung des maximalen Potentials der Graszugabe in der Großtechnik zu verhindern. Die Bewertung der Umweltwirkungen der Systeme in Berlin und Braunschweig zeigt eine hohe Eigenenergieerzeugung in beiden Systemen, so dass dadurch der Treibhauseffekt und andere relevante Umweltwirkungen vermindert werden. Dennoch kann noch Optimierungspotential bei der Energie- und Nährstoffrückgewinnung aufgezeigt werden, zu dessen Erschließung auf der Grundlage einer Szenarienanalyse Empfehlungen formuliert werden. Die Umweltvorteile der Wiederverwendung in Braunschweig zeigen sich vor allem in einer verminderten Emission von Nähr- und Schadstoffen in die Gewässer. Die Normalisierung der Umweltwirkungen unterstreicht die Bedeutung der Primärfunktion der Kläranlage (= Schutz der Oberflächengewässer), die durch Optimierung von Energiebedarf und Treibhausgasemissionen nicht eingeschränkt werden sollte. Die Risikobewertung der Braunschweiger Systems folgt dem HACCP-Konzept und quantifiziert Risiken für die menschliche Gesundheit durch Krankheitserreger und Schwermetalle in der Landwirtschaft und ökologische Risiken durch Schwermetalle. Potentielle Risiken der Wiederverwendung werden auf Grundlage quantitativer Modelle von Umweltverhalten und Exposition identifiziert (Viren, Cadmium für Menschen, Zink für Ökosystem) und sollten durch entsprechende Messprogramme überwacht werden. Schließlich werden basierend auf den Projektergebnissen Empfehlungen zur Optimierung der Energie- und Nährstoffrückgewinnung in der Abwasserbehandlung in Berlin und Braunschweig formuliert, um letztlich die negativen Umweltwirkungen zu minimieren und potentielle Risiken im Betrieb zu vermeiden.},

   title = {Optimisation of energy and nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment schemes (Executive Summary)},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2012},
   abstract = {The research project CoDiGreen (2010-2012) targets the optimisation of energy and nutrient recovery in the wastewater treatment schemes of Braunschweig and Berlin. Therefore, pilot experiments are conducted to test the effect of addition of co-substrates (grass silage, topinambur) and the thermal hydrolysis of excess sludge on the biogas yield of anaerobic digestion. In addition, co-digestion of grass silage is also tested in a full-scale digestor of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Braunschweig-Steinhof. Beside the experimental part, the environmental footprint of the wastewater treatment scheme in Braunschweig and the sludge treatment line in WWTP Berlin-Waßmannsdorf is analysed with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to identify potentials for optimisation and assess selected technical options in their effects on the environmental profile. Finally, a market review of the concept of agricultural reuse of effluent and sludge in Braunschweig is conducted to get an overview of the market situation, and a risk assessment is initiated to identify potential risks associated with this practice. The results of the pilot experiments show that both the addition of co-substrates and thermal hydrolysis can substantially increase the biogas yield and quality (CH4 content) during mesophilic digestion (HRT = 20d). Methane yields can be increased by 10%, 9% and 13% for thermal hydrolysis of excess sludge, addition of grass silage (+10% TS), and the combination of both (if the methane yield is only related to the VS of the sludge, the increase was 10%, 31% and 38%). A two-step digestion with intermediate hydrolysis (“DLD”) yields +19% CH4. No exceedance of legal requirements for inorganic and organic pollutants can be detected, whereas lab-analysis indicate positive impacts on sludge dewaterability and polymer demand for dewatering. For a full scale realisation of co-digestion it can be estimated that a 100.000 PE WWTP would require approximately 30 ha of extensively cultivated area to add +10% VS of grass substrate. However, the promising results of co-digestion with grass cannot be confirmed in full-scale trials, where only -8% of biogas yield can be measured (+2% if related to the VS of the sludge only). Even though the technical feasibility of grass addition can be shown, operational difficulties (fibre size, hydraulic mixing, low HRT) seem to prevent the realisation of the maximum potential of grass addition in full-scale. The environmental assessment of the systems in Berlin and Braunschweig reveals a high degree of energy production in both systems, lowering associated impacts of carbon footprint and other environmental impacts. However, potentials for optimisation are identified in terms of energy production and nutrient recovery, and recommendations for the future testing of technical options are given based on the scenario analysis within the LCA. Environmental benefits of the reuse approach in Braunschweig are quantified and relate mostly to the lower discharge of nutrients and other pollutants into surface waters. The normalised environmental profile underlines the primary functions of wastewater treatment (= protection of surface waters), which should not be compromised while optimising energy demand and carbon footprint.

Results show that mean effluent quality of membranes is highest, but at the cost of high electricity and chemicals demand and associated emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) or other air pollutants. In contrast, gravity-driven treatment processes require less electricity and chemicals, but can reach significant removal of phosphorus. In fact, the latter options will only lead to a minor increase of GHG emissions and energy demand compared to the existing pumping station or UV treatment.},

The "Statement of Verification" delivered at the end of the ETV process can be used as evidence that the claims made about the innovation are both credible and scientifically sound. With proof of performance credibly assured, innovations can expect an easier market access and/or a larger market share and the technological risk is reduced for technology purchasers. In the POWERSTEP project, 2 technologies were finally chosen after a section process (“quick scan”), Drum filters for primary treatment of raw wastewater (supplied by the company “Veolia Water Technologies Sweden – Hydrotech”) and the Biomethanation process for conversion of biogas or CO2 into biomethane, using a proprietary biocatalyst and reactor configuration (supplied by the company “Electrochaea”). The report summarizes the how the quick scan was carried out to select the above mentioned technologies, feedback from the two companies of the overall ETV process and their experiences as well as general feedback and recommendation to improve the ETV process in general from the POWERSTEP project point of view. It has to be mentioned that until the end of the POWERSTEP project (30th of June) the ETV verification process is not finished in both cases, so no results or feedback on the outcomes can be presented in this report.},

   abstract = {The goal of this study is the identification of ecological advantages and disadvantages of alternative sanitation systems in comparison to conventional wastewater treatment. The methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is adopted as an evaluation tool for the ecological assessment of various sanitation scenarios for a hypothetical middle-sized settlement in Germany (ca 5000 inhabitants). The scenarios include a reference system with conventional drainage and treatment in an activated sludge plant with anaerobic sludge digestion and sewage gas production. In the alternative scenarios, urine is source-separated in the toilet, collected and applied as fertilizer. Faeces are either collected by gravity drainage and composted together with biowaste or collected by a vacuum system and co-digested with biowaste to gain biogas for energy production. The remaining greywater is treated in a soil filter or in a technical plant (Sequencing batch reactor). All relevant processes of the investigated scenarios are modelled in detail for the Life Cycle Inventory, based on data from pilot plants and literature. This implies the processing of the different waste fractions, transport and energy supply, mineral fertilizer substitution, and sludge incineration. Beside the operational expenditures, the construction phase is included with material and energy demands. The resulting substance flow model is evaluated with a set of environmental indicators relating to the demand of energy, non-renewable resources, climate change, eutrophication, acidification, and various toxicity potentials. As a result, the alternative scenarios cause less environmental burden in almost all impact categories. The source-separation of human excreta disburdens the wastewater treatment process and lowers nutrient emissions into surface waters. The secondary fertilizer from urine and faeces has lower heavy metal content than an average mineral fertilizer. Depending on the system configuration, alternative sanitation systems can have a lower demand for fossil fuels and subsequently cause fewer emissions of climate-active gases. Only the increased emission of acidifying gases represents a considerable drawback compared to the conventional system. A normalisation of all indicators to the average environmental burden of a single person in Germany reveals that the decisive categories for the overall comparison are related to eutrophication, acidification, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Energy-related indicators have a smaller contribution, but they can be important in terms of world-wide scarce fossil resources and climate change. The advantages of alternative sanitation systems can only be realized if the secondary functions of mineral fertilizer substitution and energy supply are fully utilized. Important key parameters for future LCA studies of alternative sanitation systems are identified, which may simplify the data acquisition. The construction phase has only a minor relevance for the ecological assessment and may therefore be neglected in future studies. In all, the data quality of this LCA study can be further improved, because many processes of alternative systems have not yet been investigated or realized in full-scale. Hence, the development of a universal decision support method could not be realized in a reasonable way due to the lack of adequate long-term process data and the high influence of case-specific boundary conditions on the technical implementation. However, this LCA study gives a first assessment of potential ecological benefits and drawbacks of alternative sanitation systems.},

Methods of risk assessment (quantitative microbial and chemical risk assessment) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are used to characterize the risk associated with the use of reclaimed water for IPR, but also the environmental benefits compared with other options for additional drinking water supply. The LCA results show that IPR is competitive with other options of water supply in its energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Pathogens as the main health hazard are controlled effectively by existing and planned preventive measures. For chemicals the number of potentially relevant substances could be reduced substantially by the assessment.
A demonstrator phase should now be implemented to validate the outcomes of this prospective assessment by improving data quality of the initial state and by monitoring effective impacts in an operating mode.},

   abstract = {Die vorliegende wissenschaftliche Studie untersucht Potenziale und Grenzen der Hydrothermalen Karbonisierung (HTC) von entwässertem Klärschlamm zur Verbesserung der Energie- und Klimabilanz der Klärschlammentsorgung in Berlin. Für vier Berliner Klärwerke wurden Laborversuche zur HTC mit entwässertem Klärschlamm durchgeführt, um die Produkte HTC-Filtrat und hochentwässerter Klärschlamm zu charakterisieren. Mit diesen Daten und den Prozessangaben des HTC-Anbieters Terranova wurden Energieund Treibhausgasbilanzen für vier Klärwerke erstellt, die neben dem Referenzzustand 2013 für verschiedene Entsorgungswege auch die Implementierung eines HTC-Prozesses vorsehen. Abschließend wurde das HTC-Verfahren in einem technischen Pilotversuch mit zwei Berliner Klärschlämmen getestet und ebenfalls bilanziert. Die Laborversuche bestätigten die hohe Belastung des HTC-Filtrats mit CSB und N. Die organische Fracht im HTC-Filtrat zeigt im Biomethantest gute anaerobe Abbaubarkeit und einen entsprechenden Faulgasertrag. Der verbleibende CSB ist noch weiter aerob abbaubar (Zahn-Wellens-Test), so dass letztlich zwischen 1-14% der CSB-Fracht im Filtrat (7,4-14,5 g/L) als refraktär angesehen werden. Eine merkliche Rücklösung von Phoshor und Schwermetallen lässt sich erst bei stark sauren Bedingungen während der HTC (pH < 3) feststellen. Die Pilotversuche mit Klärschlamm aus Waßmannsdorf und Münchehofe in der Anlage des Anbieters Terranova konnten aufgrund von Problemen bei der Klärschlammaufgabe nicht kontinuierlich durchgeführt werden. Zudem wurde bei der abschließenden Entwässerung nicht der hohe prognostizierte TR-Gehalt im Klärschlamm erreicht (> 65% TR). Damit bleiben erhebliche Zweifel an der Betriebsstabilität und den prognostizierten Entwässerungsergebnissen bestehen. Die Energie- und Klimabilanz auf Basis der Labordaten und Herstellerangaben zeigt, dass die Einführung eines HTC-Prozesses für alle betrachteten Szenarien deutliche Vorteile bieten kann. Dabei spielt vor allem der erhöhte Faulgasertrag aus dem Prozesswasser (+16-19%) und der hohe Heizwert des hochentwässerten Klärschlamms eine Rolle. Die zusätzlichen Aufwendungen für den Prozess (Erdgas, Strom, Säure) und die höhere Rückbelastung des Klärwerks werden durch die Gutschriften ausgeglichen. Die Abwärme für den HTC-Prozess ist auf allen Klärwerken mit Faulung zu über 90% vorhanden, im Klärwerk Ruhleben sollte dazu eine separate Faulstufe für das HTC-Filtrat vorgesehen werden. Die Bilanzierung auf Basis der Daten aus den Pilotversuchen zeigt jedoch, dass die Vorteile der HTC deutlich geringer ausfallen, wenn Faulgasertrag im Filtrat und Entwässerbarkeit nicht erreicht werden. Der refraktäre CSB aus dem HTC-Filtrat kann im Ablauf der Klärwerke maximal zu einer Erhöhung des CSB-Ablaufwerts von 7-12 mg/L führen, was bei einzelnen Klärwerken eine Überschreitung der Überwachungswerte zur Folge haben kann. Dieser Aspekt ist bei der weiteren Betrachtung des HTC-Verfahrens unbedingt zu berücksichtigen. Eine Kombination von Phosphorrückgewinnung und HTC lässt sich über eine Rückgewinnung aus der Asche der Monoverbrennung oder eine vorgeschaltete P-Extraktion erreichen. Die abgeschätzten Betriebskosten der HTC-Anlage können ggf. durch Einsparungen bei der Schlammentsorgung ausgeglichen werden, wobei die Investitionskosten für eine HTC-Anlage noch unbekannt sind.},

   abstract = {The theoretical work presented here analyses various process chains for the energetic utilisation of municipal sewage sludge in their energy and greenhouse gas balance taking into account the hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC), based on the operating data of an HTC pilot plant. In the comparison with reference processes for sewage sludge dewatering (centrifuge, chamber filter press) the HTC with this offers energetic advantages with the treatment of digested sludge through high energy credit notes in the incineration and relatively small additional expenditure if the process can be operated via waste heat. For raw sludges without digestion the HTC offers no advantages as the energe tic advantage of the high calorific value are balanced out through additional outlays (natural gas, increased return loading). Decisive factors with the energetic evaluation of the HTC process are here the internal heat management and the biogas yield from the HTC process water. To be noted is, however, that the refractory COD in the process water can lead, via the return loading of the wastewater treatment plant, to considerably increased COD discharge values, which the introduction of an HTC in many cases would prevent. Along with the energy balance the HTC technology for sewage sludge should therefore be comprehensively evaluated in large-scale trials in order to investigate more accurately the economic efficiency and environmental relevance of the process.},

   abstract = {The handling and disposal of sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants contributes substantially to the costs and energy demand of wastewater treatment, accounting for around 10-20% of total costs and 15% of total energy demand. Due to the high organic content of the sludge, a considerable amount of energy can be recovered from the sludge during the stabilisation and disposal. Using state-of-the-art technology, sludge can be stabilised in anaerobic digestion (AD) tanks, converting about 50% of the organic matter into valuable biogas which is used for electricity and heat production. Advanced anaerobic digestion (DLD + cogeneration or biomethane production) can degrade 60% of organic matter and allows to cover up to 70% of energy demand (and 120% of electricity costs) of WWTPs, reducing sludge elimination costs by 50%. Furthermore, dewatered or dried sludge can be incinerated in mono- or co-incineration plants to recover the remaining part of the heating value as thermal energy or electricity using steam turbines. Recently, another promising process has been proposed for energy recovery from sewage sludge: its conversion to biochar via hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC). Using high temperature and pressure (> 180°C, 20-35 bar, >2h reaction time), the organic material of the sludge is hydrolyzed and polymerizes to coal-like particles, which after simple dewatering by filter press up to 60-70% dry matter, can then be dried and used as renewable fuel in conventional power plants. However, the process involves both the input of thermal energy and generates high-strength wastewater, affecting the overall energy efficiency and costs of this innovative route for sludge disposal. The HTC process is not new and was already described in the early 20th century. In the last decade, several research programs in Germany and Switzerland revived interest for the treatment of biomasses. Today, several continuous prototypes are in operation (for example from TerraNova in WWTP Kaiserslautern), and the first demonstration projects are underway (for example Kleve WWTP with TerraNova). The project HTC-CHECK aims at evaluating the relevance and potential of this technology for the handling of sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. The project was called by Veolia Wasser and ordered as contract study by Veolia Direction Technique. It was performed by Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) together with VERI and BS|Energy under the coordination of KWB. In detail, the following activities have been conducted in the course of the project: • A desktop study calculating a holistic energy balance and carbon footprint of selected routes for sewage sludge treatment, comparing reference technology as state-of-theart with disposal routes including HTC and also Thermal Hydrolysis (TH) in DLD configuration as alternative thermal treatment (Chapter 2). Detailed info is available in a confidential Master thesis (Warneke 2013).
• Experimental trials conducted by VERI, comparing the processes of HTC and TH in autoclave tests with sewage sludge (Chapter 3). A sum-up of these trials are presented in this report. A specific and complementary report describes in more details the conditions and results of these tests (“HTC-Check: analytical comparison of sludges produced with hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) and thermal hydrolysis (THL) technologies”, VERI report, (Sampson et al. 2013))
• A review of legal requirements for biochar incineration in Germany, conducted by BS|Energy (Chapter 4).  
The report finishes with a summary of the results and an outlook on possible future activities in this field (Chapter 5).},

   abstract = {When mapping out strategies for an integrated water resource management in urban areas the precipitation-conditioned influences on the quality of waters available as resource are considered in an increasing manner. Amongst water discharges from urban areas, combined sewer overflows (CSO) represent a particular impact on waters due to their dynamic character. To assess CSO impacts, especially for an integrated modelling of sewer system and surface waters, quantity and quality data from the interface combined sewer overflow is needed. A monitoring concept for CSOs in Berlin was developed in the context of the project Monitor-1 by the KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin. In 2009, this concept will be realised in cooperation with the Berlin water authority and the utility Berliner Wasserbetriebe. When planning and preparing a monitoring an important aspect is, adjacent from the evaluation of possible locations, the selection of suitable measuring techniques. For this, extensive tests of different online measurement techniques from reputed manufacturers were accomplished at a test facility at the TU Berlin. Apart from questions such as accuracy, response behaviour at suddenly arising load peaks or dilutions and available measuring intervals, particularly aspects of calibration, cleaning and management of the sensors were evaluated. The influence of the calibration was especially examined with the ion-selective sensors (ISE). The question was pursued, how the sensors must be calibrated to offer the greatest possible accuracy for the generally very low concentrations in surface waters and the occurrence of a sudden and precipitous rise of concentration in the case of the start of the CSO. Ammonium and nitrate were also supplemented with chemicals besides the stockpiling with waste water. An important finding was that generally all sensors are applicable for the measurement task.},

Of most concern are oxygen depressions, following the inflow of degradable organic matter via ~180 CSO outlets, along a river stretch of 16 km. For the assessment of the severity of these oxygen depressions, an existing impact-based approach suggested by Lammersen (1997) was combined with information on the local fish fauna. Application of this locally adapted assessment method to seven years of oxygen measurements at a CSO hotspot in the river yielded an annual average of 14 periods with suboptimal conditions for which adverse effects on the fish fauna are expected and 20 periods with critical conditions for which acute fish kills are possible. Further investigation on rain and sewer management data proved that such critical conditions only occurred as a direct result of CSO events, whereas suboptimal conditions are also possible at dry weather and may last up to 32 days (Riechel et al. 2010).},

   abstract = {Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) can significantly reduce runoff from urban areas. However, their
potential to mitigate acute river impacts of combined sewer overflows (CSO) is largely unknown. To close this
gap, a novel coupled model approach was deployed that simulates the effect of realistic SUDS strategies,
developed for an established city quarter, on acute oxygen depressions in the receiving river. Results show that
for an average rainfall year the SUDS strategies reduce total runoff by 28%–39% and peak runoff by 31%–48%.
Resulting relative reduction in total CSO volume ranges from 45%–58%, exceeding annual runoff reduction from
SUDS by a factor of 1.5. Negative impacts in the form of fish-critical dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in the
receiving river (<2 mg DO L? 1) can be completely prevented with the SUDS strategies for an average rainfall
year. The realistic SUDS strategies were compared with a simpler simulation approach which consists in globally
downscaling runoff from all impervious areas. It indicates that such a simple approach does not completely
account for the positive effect of SUDS, underestimating CSO volumes for specific rain events by up to 13%.
Accordingly, global downscaling is only recommended for preliminary planning purposes.},

   abstract = {To support decision makers in planning effective combined sewer overflow (CSO) management strategies an integrated modelling and impact assessment approach has been developed and applied for a large urban area in Berlin, Germany. It consists of an urban drainage model, a river water quality model and a tool for the quantification of adverse dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in the river, one of the main stressors for urban lowland rivers. The coupled model was calibrated successfully with average Nash- Sutcliffe-efficiencies for DO in the river of 0.61 and 0.70 for two validation years. Moreover, the whole range of observed DO concentrations after CSO down to 0 mg L-1 is simulated by the model. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that in the absence of CSO dissolved oxygen principally depends on phytoplankton dynamics. Regarding CSO impacts, it was shown that 97% of the observed DO deficit can be explained by the three processes (i) mixing of river water with CSO spill water poor in DO, (ii) reduced phytoplankton activity due to CSO-induced turbidity and (iii) degradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria. As expected, process (iii) turned out to be the most important one. However depending on the time lag after CSO the other processes can become dominant. Given the different involved processes, we found that different mitigation schemes tested in a scenario analysis can reduce the occurrence of critical DO deficits in the river by 30-70%. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrated sewer-river-models can be set up to represent CSO impacts under complex urban conditions. However, a significant effort in monitoring and modelling is a requisite for achieving reliable results.},

Discrimination of DO depressions, which are the direct result of combined sewer overflows (CSO) from DO depressions which are not related to CSO was achieved by combining stormwater impact guidelines with the analysis of data for: (i) rain events before critical DO depressions, (ii) water temperature (T) and conductivity as indicators for CSO impact in the river and (iii) T and DO before critical DO depressions to assess the effect of background pollution. Results indicate that the River Spree is in a critical state regarding DO for two main reasons: (a) upstream of the stretch with CSO discharge points because of background pollution and (b) downstream of the stretch because of CSO. Highly critical situations with DO < 2 mg L-1 only occurred under CSO influence.

   abstract = {In the city of Berlin combined sewer overflows (CSO) can lead to severe depressions in dissolved oxygen (DO) of receiving urban rivers and hence to acute stress for the local fish fauna. To quantify CSO impacts and optimize sewer management strategies, a model-based planning instrument has been developed. It couples the urban drainage model InfoWorks CS which simulates hydraulics and pollutant transport in the sewer with the river water quality model QSim which simulates hydraulics, mass transport and various biogeochemical processes in the receiving water body. To identify simulated CSO impacts, concentration-durationfrequency-thresholds for DO are applied to river model results via an impact assessment tool. Two kinds of impacts are distinguished: i) suboptimal conditions and ii) critical conditions for which acute fish kills are possible. In the case of Berlin, suboptimal conditions are observed on up to 92 days per year, predominantly during periods of low discharge and high temperatures whereas critical conditions only occur after CSO. For model calibration and validation, continuous measurements in both river and sewer are used. First simulations show good accordance between simulated and measured DO concentration in the river with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies between 0.70 and 0.79 for an eight-month time period at three different river monitoring points. However, to assure satisfactory model performance for adverse DO conditions in particular, impact assessment results for measured and simulated data are compared. Regarding suboptimal DO conditions simulated and measured data show good agreement. Nevertheless model representation for critical conditions is poor for some river sections and requires further improvement for CSO conditions. The results underline the importance of combining different validation approaches when dealing with complex systems.},

   abstract = {Combined sewer systems are one of the major sources of microbiological contamination in urban water bodies. However, identification of hotspots for pathogen emissions is not straightforward, especially in large and complex drainage systems. To determine the relevance of different CSO outlets for bathing water quality a simple tracer approach which uses wastewater volume as a proxy for pathogen emissions has been developed and tested for the city of Berlin, Germany. The approach reveals that the average wastewater ratio in CSO varies largely between different river outlets (0 to 15%). Hence, the outlets with the largest CSO volumes are not automatically the greatest wastewater emitters and assumed hotspots for pathogen contamination do not coincide with hydraulic hotspots. This is verified with own measurements that show enormous differences in pathogen concentrations between waste and stormwater of 4 orders of magnitude. As a result, wastewater which represents only 5% of the CSO volume contributes > 99% of the pathogen loadings to the river. The study highlights the relevance of wastewater volumes for the identification of point sources for the hygienic impairment of water bodies.},

Both pilots were optimised for nitrification, denitrification, and enhanced biological phosphorous elimination, treating identical municipal waste water under comparable operating conditions. The only constructional difference between the pilots was the position of the denitrification zone (pre-denitrification in pilot 1 and post-denitrification in pilot 2). Despite identical modules and conditions, the two MBRs showed different permeabilities and fouling rates. The differences were not related to the denitrification scheme. In order to find an explanation for the different membrane performances, a one-year investigation was initiated and the membrane performance as well as the operating regime and characteristics of the activated sludge were closely studied. MLSS concentrations, solid retention time, loading rates, and filtration flux were found not to be responsible for the different performance of the submerged modules. These parameters were kept identical in the two pilot plants. Instead, the non-settable fraction of the sludges (soluble and colloidal material, i.e. polysaccharides, proteins and organic colloids) was found to impact fouling and to cause the difference in membrane performance between the two MBR. This fraction was analysed by spectrophotometric and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) methods. In a second step, the origin of these substances was investigated. The results point to microbiologically produced substances such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) or soluble microbial product.},

This paper shows a possibility to overcome this problem by using a hybrid sewer model, which is a conjunction of conceptual and mechanistic modelling approaches to combine the calculating speed of conceptual models and the accuracy of mechanistic models in one model. The implementation of a hybrid sewer model was performed and tested in two case studies, in Berlin (Germany) for 6 representative catchments and in Herent (Flanders, Belgium) for one sewer system, using the hydrodynamic modelling software InfoWorks CS. Besides the motivation of the case studies on the sewer systems in Berlin and Herent this paper presents the methodologies developed for a hybrid simplification of the sewer network model, considering the calibration of the simplified network as well as the evaluation of the simplification performance. The use of a hybrid model for both case studies is then evaluated and the transferability of the methodologies is discussed.},

   year = {2012},
   abstract = {In agricultural watersheds affected by diffuse pollution, limitation of fertilizer and pesticide application may not be sufficient to achieve good river water quality. After waterworks had to be closed in Brittany due to elevated nitrate concentrations in the river Ic (> 50 mg-NO3 L-1), the project Aquisafe has been initiated. The objective of Aquisafe is to reduce pollutant loads (nitrate and pesticides) from agricultural fields by implementation of near-natural mitigation zones at diffuse pollution hotspots at the head of watersheds. Simple and small solutions have to be designed in order to more efficiently reduce nitrate and pesticide concentrations in receiving rivers. In addition, a planning tool has to be developed to determine optimal locations to construct these systems. Finally, a tool to assess the effectiveness of these reactive zones on watershed water quality will be implemented. In order to reach the first objective, design features are tested on three scales: 1) laboratory scale, 2) technical scale and 3) field scale. 1) In the laboratory, column experiments were conducted with different organic substrates at short hydraulic residence times (HRT). The efficiency for parallel reduction of nitrate and two common herbicides in Europe, Bentazon and Isoproturon, was explored (Krause Camilo, 2012). 2) In technical scale, two parallel swales were filled with the most suitable material determined in (1) for a one year test. The influence of HRT and temperature was investigated. For nitrate, high reduction could be achieved at short HRT; results for herbicides still have to be confirmed. 3) One infiltration ditch and two simple wetlands were constructed in Brittany (France), taking into account experiences from other scales. These systems are now monitored to investigate the effects of upscaling. Site locations were chosen based on a validated and repeatable GIS-based overlay method that prioritises zones of potential contribution to nitrate pollution (Orlikowski et al, 2011). Additionally, a new wetland module is being developed for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). It allows to predict impacts of wetland constructions on nitrate concentrations in receiving rivers; the module is now implemented but still has to be calibrated with in situ monitoring results. The presentation will focus on results of the up-scaling approach, and will show how the tools of Aquisafe can be used for supporting the development of strategies at catchment scale.},

Das KWB arbeitete als einer der Projektpartner in Nitrolimit an der Modellierung der Gewässergüte von Flusssystemen am Beispiel der Berliner Stadtspree mittels QSim. Es wurde gezeigt, dass das Phytoplanktonwachstum dort derzeit nicht durch Nährstoffe, sondern vorwiegend durch Licht limitiert ist. Dennoch kann Phosphor bei einem entsprechend niedrigen Nährstoff- und Phytoplankton-Grundniveau zur steuernden Größe werden. Damit bestätigt das Modell die Hypothese, dass auch in urbanen, stark nährstoffbelasteten Gewässern eine Nährstofflimitation erreicht werden kann. Obwohl aus der Arbeit keine konkrete Grenzkonzentration abgeleitet werden kann, bedeutet das Ergebnis für die Praxis, dass bei entsprechenden Gewässern eine bedeutende Nährstoffreduktion notwendig ist, um einen positiven Effekt auf die Gewässergüte zu erreichen. Bei der Suche nach einer geeigneten Strategie für die Verbesserung des ökologischen Zustandes eines Gewässers wurde in Nitrolimit am Beispiel der unteren Havel die Strategie verfolgt, sowohl ökologische wie auch sozioökonomische Aspekte zu berücksichtigen. Wichtige Grundlage dafür waren Informationen zu Kosten und Wirksamkeit von einzelnen Maßnahmen zur Reduktion der Stickstoffeinträge aus den Bereichen Landwirtschaft und urbane Systeme. Diese Informationen wurden in Form eines Maßnahmenkatalogs in einer Datenbank zusammengefasst. Das KWB war hier verantwortlich für die Maßnahmen aus dem urbanen Bereich und veröffentlichte diese Ergebnisse separat als Nitrolimit Diskussionspapier Band 2. Über eine Ökobilanz wurden zudem nicht-monetäre ökologische Auswirkungen von weitergehenden Stickstoffeliminierungsverfahren für Großkläranlagen beschrieben. Dabei wurden alle direkten und indirekten ökologischen Auswirkungen von fünf Verfahren auf Großkläranlagen in einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtungsweise untersucht und verglichen. So konnten die direkten Effekte der verbesserten Ablaufqualität hinsichtlich der N-Fracht den zusätzlichen Aufwendungen durch die vorgelagerten Prozesse (resultierend aus dem veränderten Strom- und Chemikalienverbrauch und der benötigten Infrastruktur) gegenübergestellt werden. Es zeigte sich, dass die einzelnen Maßnahmen bei vergleichbaren Wirkungen auf die N-Fracht sehr unterschiedliche zusätzliche Aufwendungen in Energieverbrauch und Treibhausgasemissionen erfordern. Letztendlich war es möglich, Szenarien für die Verbesserung des Zustandes der Unteren Havel vorzuschlagen und zu analysieren. Es haben dafür mehrfach Gespräche mit den Stakeholder aus Berlin und Brandenburg (SenStadtUm, BWB, LUGV) stattgefunden, um die Entwicklung der Szenarien abzustimmen. Das KWB prüfte und validierte in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem IGB und der TUB die Ergebnisse des Nährstoffmodells MONERIS für die verschiedenen Szenarien.},

   abstract = {In Berlin, Germany, the demand for enhanced protection of the environment and the growing economic pressure have led to an increased application of control concepts within the sewage system. A global control strategy to regulate the pumpage of the combined sewage system to the treatment plant was developed and evaluated in a theoretical study. The objective was to reduce CSO. In this paper an extension of the existing control algorithm by information from online rainfall measurement and radar nowcasting is described. The rainfall information is taken into account by two additive terms describing the predicted volume from rainfall runoff. On the basis of numerical simulation the potential of these two complementary forecast terms in the global control algorithm to further reduce CSO is evaluated. The investigations are based on long-time simulations that are conducted with the dynamic flow routing model InfoWorks for three subcatchments of the Berlin drainage system. The results show that at the current Berlin system a CSO reduction of only 0.8% is possible. The effect of the forecast terms is limited by operational constraints. Limits are set to both, the delivery from each individual pump station and the total pumpage to the treatment plant.},

The objective was to analyse the applicability of four electronic noses for sewer odour management. 11 evaluation criteria were defined to evaluate the E-noses measurement behaviour, stability and their general practicability and handling. Generally it can be mentioned that the results are promising and the E-noses show good potentials. The E-noses which showed good results in predicting the odour concentration at the site have lack of some practical features. Whereas the systems which provide more possibilities (e.g. remote control, direct odour display) and have more complex gas preparation or measurements modes (like thermal desorption) showed lower capabilities to measure the actual odour at the site.},

   abstract = {The quality of the River Spree during its passage through the city of Berlin is mainly influenced by the discharge of treated effluent from waste water treatment plants and by combined sewer overflows (CSO). CSO are discharged diffusely and during short periods of time leading to acute impacts like oxygen depletion and locally increased ammonia concentration in the river. They are dominant stress factors to Berlin’s lowland River Spree and its biocenosis. In order to improve the water quality of the River Spree, measures limiting the emissions of CSO are envisaged such as utilization of in‐pipe storage capacities, implementation of weirs for real‐time control, construction of additional stormwater tanks. In order to build an efficient and immission oriented strategy with the different available solutions and to be able to cope with future challenges the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB), Berliner Wasserbetriebe, Veolia Water and the Berlin Senate of Environment are conducting two projects, the EU project PREPARED and the MIA‐CSO project. An impact‐based CSO management instrument is being developed with the aim to evaluate measures of CSO control. It consists in (i) a river water quality/ecosystem model that will be used to simulate water quality processes in the receiving water and (ii) a methodology to identify critical water quality situations occurring in the Spree River. For model adaptation, calibration and validation an integrated monitoring is conducted. The monitoring consists in (i) continuously measuring the quality and flow of CSO discharges at one representative network location and (ii) in parallel, continuously monitoring water quality parameters at 5 sites within the impacted stretch of the Spree River. The concept of the integrated monitoring, i.e. definition of monitoring sites as well as monitoring strategy and design will be presented during the M3 Workshop.},

CYN occurrence in the German lakes could not be ascribed to the three known CYN-producing species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, which were detected in some lakes in low abundances. The highest correlation coefficients were observed between particulate CYN and the native Aphanizomenon gracile. It occurred in 98 CYN-positive samples, was the most abundant Nostocales and was the only Nostocales in five samples. This indicates that A. gracile is a potential CYN producer in German lakes.},

   year = {2006},
   abstract = {Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a filamentous freshwater cyanobacterium of tropical and subtropical origin that spread out up to northern temperate zone during the last decades. Belonging to the order Nostocales it can differentiate two types of nonvegetative cells: i) heterocysts, in which it can fix molecular nitrogen, and ii) akinetes, which are resting stages, that allow the species to pass-by unfavourable growth conditions in the sediment. In the tropics and subtropics, C. raciborskii is a perennial species, which often occurs in bloom densities, and which is prominent for the synthesis of various toxins including the potent hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and neurotoxic paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins. In Europe, its northernmost populations were found in North German lakes. Here, it occurs only during the summer months and has not been observed to form mass developments. The highest documented biomass it attained was 23 % of the total phytoplankton biomass. To investigate the spatial occurrence and relative frequency of C. raciborskii, we undertook a systematic survey, sampling 142 water bodies in the lowland region of Northeast Germany from June till September 2004. The cyanobacteria species present were analysed qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. C. raciborskii was a common species. It was present in 39 of the samples, of which 62 % were new findings. Further, we detected two additional thermophilic Nostocales that have not been reported from Germany before: Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides. These are the most northerly reports of both species so far. A. bergii occurred in 13 and A. aphanizomenoides in 19 of the 142 water bodies sampled. To elucidate the regulation mechanisms of the population dynamics of C. raciborskii and its abiotic boundaries in the newly invaded habitats furthermore long-term data series (1993 - 2005) of two polymictic shallow lakes in the study area were analyzed. Population sizes largely varied between years without any distinct long-term trend. In the annual course, filaments of the species occurred in the pelagial at temperatures above 15 - 17 °C, i.e. akinetes must have been germinated at temperatures below 15 °C. Population growth started at high rates (1.5 - 2.8 d-1) that declined continuously over the season. Growth rates were not significantly correlated with temperature but they were significantly positive correlated with the mean photosynthetic active radiation in the mixed water column (Imix). At the time population starts growing, Imix has exceeded its annual maximum, and growth rate declines with decreasing Imix. The time of akinete germination is therefore of crucial importance for the success of the population: as earlier akinetes germinate the higher the growth rate will be, resulting in a greater population size, a higher number of akinetes produced, and vice versa. Therefore, we conclude that an earlier increase of the water temperature due to global warming is a major cause for the spreading of C. raciborskii into the temperate zone.},

One of the tasks within the project is the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) to assess the feasibility of BF systems under varying boundary conditions such as: (i) quality of surface and ambient groundwater, (ii) local hydrological and hydrogeological properties (e.g. clogging layer) and (iii) well field design (distance to bank) and operation (pumping rates). Since the successful, cost-effective implementation of BF systems requires the optimization of different objectives such as (i) optimizing the BF share in order to maintain a predefined raw water quality or (ii) maintaining a predefined minimum travel time between bank and production well, both aspects are addressed within the DSS. As an example for a practical application the DSS is tested with data from the Palla well field in Delhi/India. As a result optimal shares of bank filtrate were calculated for the monsoon and non-monsoon season. By simulating different pumping and clogging scenarios with the BF Simulator optimal pumping rates were derived. The DSS proved to be a good qualitative tool to identify and learn about the trade-offs a decision maker has to make due to the (i) inherently competing nature of different objectives (e.g. high BF share and minimum travel time > 50 d) and the (ii) inherent uncertainty due to the large natural variability of boundary conditions (e.g. clogging layer). Since both characteristics can be addressed within the DSS it helps to add transparency and reproducibility to the decision making process. An additional advantage is that its application requires only low effort concerning time, money, and manpower. Thus the application of the DSS is recommended to accompany decision making processes especially in developing and newly industrialised countries where data availability and low financial budgets are usually the major burden for the application of more complex, data-demanding decision support tools. However, it needs to be considered that in practice additional parameters like water availability, energy efficiency and cost-benefit need to be taken into account.},

One of the tasks within the project was the identification of state-of-the-art tools in the field of well field optimization modelling. Most of the currently used tools are process-driven simulation models like MODFLOW or FEFLOW. These are sometimes also combined with optimization models to reduce the computational demand and are utilized as strategic planning tools for water supply managers. However, in case of optimizing well field operation (i) under relatively constant boundary conditions and (ii) enough field data (temporal and spatial resolution dependent of the dynamics of the state parameter of interest, e.g. groundwater table, contaminant concentrations) data-driven approaches like support vector machines (SVM) can be used instead. If the water manager’s key interest is only a good predictive capability in combination with low computational demand, the application of this approach is more goal-orientated to simulate the dynamics of well field performance indicators efficiently. The contents of this report were presented to possible end-users, experts from Berliner Wasserbetriebe and Veolia. In agreement with their recommendations it was decided to focus further research within TECHNEAU on the empirical, data driven modelling approach. The selected approach is currently tested in the framework of a diploma thesis for a Berlin waterworks with the objective to analyse available production and observation well hydrographs by using modern statistical methods like principal component analysis and SVM (www.support-vector-machines.org).},

One of the tasks of WP 5.2 is to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) as a first qualitative tool to assess the feasibility of bank filtration for drinking water supply in developing countries. The Bank Filtration Simulator (BFS), which is the subject of this report, is a sub-model used within the DSS to compute steady-state solutions for a two dimensional groundwater flow field in the horizontal plane for BF settings. Input parameters are required for aquifer, bank and well characteristics to calculate the BF share analytically. In addition the minimum travel time between bank and well is computed numerically. The sensitivity analysis yielded that the analytical calculated BF share is the most reliable output parameter, since its value is grid-independent. The most sensitive input parameters for the BF share calculation are the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the clogging parameter, which both are the most uncertain ones to estimate. The accuracy of the numerically computed minimum traveltime of the BFS was cross-checked against a MODFLOW model, which produced only a very small discrepancy below 5%. Due to the lacking time-dependency of the BFS model its application is only appropriate on a management horizon for which the system’s boundary conditions (e.g. baseflow, clogging parameter and pumping rates) do not change significantly over time. In a nutshell it is therefore highly recommended to use the BFS only as a qualitative assessment tool in a first planning step to evaluate the feasibility of BF systems. Nevertheless the qualitative outputs give a valuable physically based insight of the system’s behaviour for distinct operational scenarios (e.g. minimal/maximum pumping rates) in order to add transparency and reproducibility to the decision making process.},

One of the tasks within the project is the testing of a data-driven approach for the identification (pattern recognition) and quantification of the key processes that drive the groundwater (GW) dynamics in observation wells (OW) near well fields of a BF waterworks. For this BUSSE (2010) used a multivariate statistical method (principal component analysis - PCA) with daily GW level time series of 41 OWs and was able to identify four processes that explained 95% of the total variance in the data set. On the one hand GW recharge (58.9%) and its temporal delay (3.3%) explain 62% of the GW level fluctuations within the study period. On the other hand any discernible impact of waterworks abstractions is limited to one of the three well fields with the highest production rate (29.8% of explained variance). In addition the infiltration of a marshy ditch into the GW accounts for another 2.9% of the GW level fluctuations. Regarding the ability to identify driving forces for GW level fluctuations the main advantage for using PCA compared to process-driven GW flow modelling is that the driving forces for GW level fluctuations can be identified and quantified without requiring exact knowledge about the structural properties of the subsurface (e.g. aquifer transmissivities) and its input parameters (e.g. GW recharge, production rates). Note that the latter do not enter the PCA directly but are used for spatiotemporal interpretation of the results, which also requires some expertise. In addition, it is recommended to perform a sensitivity analysis of the PCA results in a next step, so that it can be tested whether the processes identified above are robust in case of changing input parameters such as: - Reduced spatiotemporal resolution - Study period with different boundary conditions (e.g. pumping regime). The contents of this report were presented to the involved experts from the Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB). In agreement with their recommendations it was decided to focus further research within follow-up projects on the (i) sensitivity analysis of the PCA results and (ii) to apply nonlinear approaches for identification and quantification of processes that drive GW quality dynamics within the study area.},

One of the tasks within this work package is to assess the costefficiency of BF systems. For this a comparative cost analysis (CCA) between groundwater waterworks using BF as natural pre-treatment step and surface water treatment plants (SWTPs) is performed. The CCA yielded that, under the assumption of equally low surface water quality, BF systems are more cost-efficient than SWTPs. This result is in line with the general water source priority of water suppliers, which prefer resources with the best water quality and security under the constraint of guaranteeing sufficient water availability. Furthermore the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the natural boundary condition 'pumping rate per production well' has a major impact on the specific total costs of BF systems. Lower pumping rates lead to increasing capital costs for the additional production wells, which are not fully compensated through pumping cost savings and thus lead to increasing total costs. In addition the result of the monitoring scenario clearly confirmed that for this aspect groundwater waterworks have a structural disadvantage compared to surface waterworks. Subsequently, if monitoring costs are taken into account, a higher critical pumping rate per production well is required to exceed the break-even-point. In a nutshell the CCA shall support water supply managers in the complex process of making rational investment decisions. However, since within this analysis only water abstraction and treatment process costs are considered, the CCA does not cover the total cost structure of a waterworks (e.g. costs of building sites). Thus the application of the CCA is only valid if both (i) neglected costs and (ii) benefits are in the same order of magnitude for all alternatives (exception: most cost-efficient alternative provides excess benefits). In case that the above stated prerequisites are not fulfilled, the CCA is only a first step in the economic assessment and more powerful evaluation methods (e.g. cost-benefit analysis) are needed.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2016},
   abstract = {Objective of this synthesis report is to summarise the main achievements of the OPTIWELLS-2 project. Based on a preparatory phase OPTIWELLS-1 (2011-2012), the main project phase OPTIWELLS-2 (2012-2015) included the development of two different optimisation modelling methodologies (data-driven, process-driven) for minimising a well field’s specific energy demand whilst satisfying both, water demand and water quality constraints. Chapter 2 gives a short overview on the technical background on pipe hydraulics and the general methodology used within the project. The general workflow of the testing and application for the three case study well fields investigated within OPTIWELLS-2 is summarised in Chapter 3. For the first two case studies (Chapter Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden. and Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.), a process-driven modelling approach was used, which enabled the assessment of three different management strategies (smart well field management, pump renewal or a combination of both) on the specific energy demand. This approach was more time and data-demanding (Chapter 2.5) compared to the data-driven approach used for the third case study (Chapter Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.). The cross-case analysis (Chapter 4) showed, that the energetic prediction accuracy of process-driven modelling (Chapter 4.1.3) was improved significantly by using pump characteristics derived from audits instead of relying on manufacturer data, whilst including steady-state well drawdown compared to assuming a static water level in the production well was much less important. This can be explained by the fact, that well drawdown contributed to less than 3% of the required pump head (Chapter 4.1.1), whilst the offset between audit and manufacturer pump characteristics is much more relevant because of pump ageing during long usage periods (up to 40 years). The data-based modelling approach used for Site C has yielded energy consumption forecasts with a similar accuracy, but is more robust as it relies on operational data, thus requiring no calibration.
Optimisation modelling results (Chapter 4.1.3) obtained for three case study well fields indicate that optimised well operation reduces energy consumption up to 20%. The supplementary replacement of particularly aged pumps increases the savings even up to 50%, in case that very aged pumps were formerly operated at high priority. A newly developed pump database comprising the relevant facts of submersible pumps of different manufacturers can be used for the selection of suitable pumps (Chapter 6.1.2).
Testing the methodology developed in OPTIWELLS-2 for minimising the well field’s specific energy demand was limited to three small to medium sized well field sites ranging from 6 to 18 submersible pumps. However, the methodology should be also scalable, i.e. applicable for larger well field sites without being too expensive. Currently this is not possible, because important parameters required for assessing the in-situ pump characteristics (pumping rate, pressure head and power demand of pump, water level in well) are typically not logged by the operators with a sufficient temporal resolution. To overcome this data shortage, time-consuming pump audits were required, but these provide only a snapshot that in addition can be fast outdated (for example if that the pumps are renewed). Thus, future research in the field of energetic well field optimisation should focus on: (i) the identification (or equipment) of a bigger well field with data loggers and (ii) testing of the data-driven approach for this (large) well field.},

   number = {Report number 2012.010, D 5.1.2.b. PREPARED},
   year = {2012},
   abstract = {The project PREPARED – enabling change has the objective to develop and demonstrate methods and tools that enable water utilities to adapt to climate change, e.g. for planning resilient water supply and sanitation systems. Within WP 5.1 investigations are carried out to support utilities that need to manage urban water supply under climate change conditions, with the aim to avoid energy-consumptive technical upgrade by smart resource management. For Berlin, decision support for managing an urban-semi closed water cycle is developed taking into account the problems and difficulties of the city and its surroundings. This deliverable shall describe the framework of this system, identify relevant management options and assess their impact under changing future conditions. Two major challenges have been identified for the future water supply of the city of Berlin, that relies to 60 % indirectly on surface water from the two main Rivers Spree and Havel, which is abstracted through production wells located close to the rivers via bank filtration (BF) and additional artificial recharge (AR): - Due to decreasing precipitation (- 10 % until 2040) and increasing temperatures (leading to an increase in evaporation of about 2 %) the discharge in the Elbe catchment is predicted to decrease significantly (- 40 %). This will lead to a rise in treated effluent share in the city’s surface waters, especially during summer. As a result of the abandonment of open-pit lignite mines upstream of Berlin and their subsequent flooding and transition into large lakes the concentrations of mining-related substances (especially sulphate) are expected to increase in the next years. Analysis of existing data yielded no sulphate-related issues for Berlin’s water supply at current stage (SO4 concentrations for the Berlin WW range between 60-150 mg/l except for one WW, which shows significantly higher SO4 concentrations above 200 mg/l). So far no increase in sulphate in potable water has been observed over the past 20 years and it is especially those water works with higher shares of ambient groundwater that tend to show elevated sulphate concentrations. On the other hand there are indications that the constant, comparatively high sulphate concentrations in potable water support the development of odour and corrosion problems in the sewage system. This is additionally enforced by the on-going strong reduction in water consumption, leading to lower flow rates and higher sedimentation rates in the sewerage system. Here further monitoring of all sulphur species at waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) inlet is recommended to quantify the effect of drinking water sulphate values compared to user input. Although potable and waste-water related activities accounted to less than 10 % of the overall sulphate load leaving the city of Berlin, the following technical options for controlling sulphate were analysed within this study and yielded the following results: i) Optimising waste-water and surface water treatment Only 5 % of total SO4 loads within the Berlin water cycle originated from WWTPs and the surface water treatment plant Tegel, while 95 % of total SO4 loads (entering the Berlin water cycle) were due to given boundary conditions (surface water inflows: 91%, abstraction of ambient groundwater: 4%). Consequently optimising waste-water and surface water treatment (i.e. replacing sulphate based with non-sulphate based flocculation aids) would only lead to a very limited SO4 load reduction within the Berlin water cycle. ii) Optimisation of raw water quality by smart well field management On the basis of a process-driven water quality model it was shown that a reduction of SO4 concentrations of up to 20 mg/L could be achieved for the Berlin waterworks Wuhlheide by smart well field management alone. However, the benefit of reduced SO4 concentrations needs to be weighted against the risk of increased concentrations of other potentially harmful water substances by the water supply manager. iii) Water treatment (upstream, downstream) If SO4 concentrations in the raw water cannot be controlled by smart well field management alone, additional treatment schemes would be required. A literature review yielded that the analysed downstream treatment methods iron exchange (CARIX®) and nanofiltration clearly outperformed the upstream treatment methods (bioreactors, natural & constructed wetlands). The latter showed only limited SO4 reduction efficiencies (especially during water) and thus were more costly. Based on the findings above, the process-driven raw water quality optimisation by smart well field management should be demonstrated at a sulphate-sensitive water works in a next step. In addition further investigations are necessary in the field of sulphur species in waste water and sewage system as well as on the performance of the identified water treatment methods nanofiltration and ion exchange (CARIX®) under the conditions met in Berlin.},

   abstract = {The groundwater drawdown model WTAQ-2, provided by the United States Geological Survey for free, has been “wrapped” into an R package, which contains functions for writing input files, executing the model engine and reading output files. By calling the functions from the R package a sensitivity analysis, calibration or validation requiring multiple model runs can be performed in an automated way. Automation by means of programming improves and simplifies the modelling process by ensuring that the WTAQ-2 wrapper generates consistent model input files, runs the model engine and reads the output files without requiring the user to cope with the technical details of the communication with the model engine. In addition the WTAQ-2 wrapper automatically adapts cross-dependent input parameters correctly in case one is changed by the user. This assures the formal correctness of the input file and minimises the effort for the user, who normally has to consider all cross-dependencies for each input file modification manually by consulting the model documentation. Consequently the focus can be shifted on retrieving and preparing the data needed by the model. Modelling is described in the form of version controlled R scripts so that its methodology becomes transparent and modifications (e.g. error fixing) trackable. The code can be run repeatedly and will always produce the same results given the same inputs. The implementation in the form of program code further yields the advantage of inherently documenting the methodology. This leads to reproducible results which should be the basis for smart decision making.},

   abstract = {Last decades the concern about energy consumption has globally arisen due to awareness on climate change and the increase of energy prices. In the water field the nexus between water and energy has been extensively studied, however, there has been little discussion about energy-efficient specific approaches. This master thesis is part of the OPTIWELLS project which addresses to determine more energy efficient techniques for water supply operation, in particular for water abstraction well fields. One option to optimize a well field preserving its structure or components is the “smart well field management”, which maximize the time during which the pumps are performing on their best efficiency point, guaranteeing the water demand. The smart well field management is complex and accounts for various integrated processes. The aim of the project is to develop a prototype of a software tool able to cope with this complex optimisation problem. In particular, this master thesis deals with the modelling of a case study, applying methodologies that will be implemented in the OPTIWELLS prototype tool. Results and methods of data analysis for a well field, including a site audit, are described. The well field modelling was carried out with EPANET software by means of its Programmer’s Toolkit. No reliable data to validate the energy consumption estimation of the model were available. However, the report shows that observed hydraulic conditions of an abstraction well field can be accurately reproduced. The impact of different modelling approaches and amount of data available on energy evaluation is also drawn. Some insight into the well field current conditions (current pump curve, drawdown, water quality, specific energy demand,..) are discussed and recommendations or the operation of the case study site will be given.},

   year = {2014},
   abstract = {The Wilmersdorf Catchment, part of the Berlin combined sewer system, faces severe problems regarding combined sewer overflows (CSO) and flooding which might worsen due to climate change and ongoing urbanisation. Rather than investing in costly adaptations, the goal of this study is to improve the utilisation of the existing storage capacity of the network in order to reduce CSO and flooding. The potential for optimisation was investigated by means of performance criteria (CSO volume, overflow peak and duration, flood volume and duration, number of flooded nodes) defined to assess the severity of CSO and flood events. This study takes a double interest in including dynamic and static adaptive measures to examine on one hand the potential improvement of the real-time control (RTC) strategy, and on the other hand the possible adaptation of existing structures in the network. To investigate these measures, a 1D-hydrodynamic model of the sewer network planned for 2020 was provided within the modelling package InfoWorks CS. The indicators were used to characterise the performance of the status-quo network as well as each implemented measure under a range of design storms. Three successful measures – the increase of a throttle pipe diameter and the elevation of two different overflow crests were identified to be effective for CSO reduction. On the other hand, adaptations of the RTC strategy did not lead to an improvement of the CSO aspect. The results of the simulations involving individual measures revealed that an optimisation of the network by making minor adjustments is possible. Indeed, CSO volume is almost halved under a 3-month rainfall after one overflow crest was elevated of 80 cm. Furthermore, a combination of the three best measures could reduce CSO volume by almost 60% for the same rainfall intensity. However, even though no significant worsening of flooding occurs, the main limitation of this type of measures is their inability to cope with flooding issues. Additional research should be conducted to complete the preliminary results that constitute this thesis and to fully determine the potential of the catchment, especially regarding the flooding aspect. In particular, decentralised measures that increase the pervious fraction of the surface could supplement this study.},

Canonical correlation results showed that the maximum and average rainfall intensities are the most influential variables to describe CSO water quantity and pollutant loads whereas the duration of the rainfall event and the rain depth seem to be the most influential variables to describe CSO pollutant concentrations. The analysis of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models confirms the findings of the canonical correlation and highlights three main influences of rainfall on CSO characteristics: (i) CSO water quantity characteristics are mainly influenced by the maximal rainfall intensities, (ii) CSO pollutants concentrations were found to be mostly associated with duration of the rainfall and (iii) pollutants loads seemed to be principally influenced by dry weather duration before the rainfall event. The prediction quality of PLS models is rather low (R² < 0.6) but results can be useful to explore qualitatively the influence of rainfall on CSO characteristics.},

Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es, auf der Grundlage zweier in Berlin mit kommunalem Abwasser betriebenen MBR-Anlagen die Kosten semizentraler MBRAnlagen in Abhängigkeit von ihrer Größe und ihrer Reinigungsleistung zu vergleichen. Es handelt sich bei diesen Anlagen um eine Demonstrationsanlage für 130 EW und eine Pilotanlage für 50 EW, wobei sich die Technisierungsgrade und Reinigungsziele der beiden Anlagen stark unterscheiden. Ein Upscaling machte den Vergleich zwischen MBR-Anlagen mit Größen von 50 bis 5.000 EW möglich. Die Investitionskosten wurden anhand der einzelnen Anlagenteile aufgegliedert und für größere Anlagen mit Hilfe der Kapazitätsmethode abgeschätzt. In die Betrachtung der Betriebskosten gingen Personal-, Schlammentsorgungs-, Energie- und Chemikalienkosten sowie die Kosten für Wartung und Instandhaltung und die Abwasserabgabe ein. Aus den ermittelten Investitions- und Betriebskosten wurden mit einer dynamischen Kostenvergleichsrechnung die durchschnittlichen Jahreskosten berechnet. Um die Reinigungsleistung zu bewerten, wurde eine Einteilung in Reinigungsklassen mit unterschiedlichen Eliminationsraten für den chemischen Sauerstoffbedarf, Stickstoff und Phosphor vorgenommen, in die die MBR-Anlagen eingeordnet wurden. Die Untersuchung ergab, dass die vergleichsweise hohen spezifischen Kosten der betriebenen Anlagen mit zunehmender Anlagengröße stark abfallen. Sie sinken bei einer Anlagengröße von 1.000 EW auf ca. 2 €/m³. Die Erreichung einer hohen Ablaufgüte kann durch unterschiedliche Technologien erzielt werden.

This resulted in a pronounced reduction of phosphorus concentrations in the lake water, followed by a decline of chlorophyll-a concentrations. However, for many years P release from sediments due to mineralization and desorption of sedimentary P continued. In Schlachtensee, the presence of nitrate above the sediment suppresses P release, because the Fe/P ratio is sufficient to provide enough aerobic sorption capacity. In Lake Tegel, some P release occurs even under aerobic conditions because of the low aerobic P sorption capacity of the sediments. There, nitrate could moderate the P release peaks which occur when the Fe-P cycle at the sediment water interface is disturbed by precipitation of iron sulfide after reduction of sulfate during times of high mineralization intensity. The potentially mobile P pool in the sediments of both lakes is rather small, indicating that the P release could subside after sufficient reduction of the external P load in Lake Tegel and the disruption of the internal P cycle in Schlachtensee.

For practitioners, the key question in modelling aquatic ecosystems is how well models describe system reactions to changes – particularly trophic change and climate change – and in consequence, how useful models are for predicting system responses and for informing water-body management. For researchers, the modelling objective is to investigate functional interactions between ecosystem components, to understand complex causalities and to identify knowledge gaps to close with further lab and field work. Ideally, successful modelling should address both purposes. A need for more intensive communication between modellers of both groups, as well as other model users, was identified at a modellers’ workshop organised by the project “OLIGO” in autumn 2005. OLIGO (2003-2007) was a project of the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB), executed by researchers of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) and the Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) and funded by Veolia Water. Following up on the recommendation of this workshop and in the context of finalising this project, UBA together with KWB organised a 2-day workshop in Berlin, 8-9 November 2007. The workshop was hosted by the Berliner Wasserbetriebe and brought together 60 modellers and model users from 6 countries. The workshop aimed to consolidate and document the state of the art in modelling water quality in reaction to nutrient load or climate change, to discuss how well current lake and reservoir models can support and inform decision-makers, including dealing with the uncertainty of model predictions, and to explore future perspectives and needs for the development of models.},

The database was created using standard software (MS ACCESS) and references were managed by open source software (JABREF). The compiled data on European MAR sites was taken from a variety of different source types, including scientific articles, books, PhD, diploma and master's theses, presentations, technical documents, reports from previous national and EU research projects, personal communication with specialists, operators and water authorities, community and operator websites, newspaper articles, and Google Earth (for geographic coordinates to create overview maps). On the basis of this database a classification system for the MAR sites found in Europe will be developed that can be used for deriving site-specific pre-requisites and design criteria as guidance for the authorization of for new sites.},

   abstract = {The total phosphorus concentration (TP) in Berlin’s surface waters has to be decreased to 6090 μg/L to achieve good ecological conditions. Furthermore, securing the bathing water quality of surface waters gains more attention. The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ruhleben should be upgraded by tertiary treatment to reduce the TP concentration (< 80 μg/L) and the pathogen germ concentration in the WWTP effluent. The project OXERAM compares different filtration technologies with regard to their efficiency and applicability as tertiary treatment. In this thesis the combination of microsieve filtration and UV-disinfection has been investigated. Before this trial the microsieve was rebuilt after a one year operation period. The volume of the coagulation tank was reduced to 26 % (0.56 m³) of its initial volume. The coagulation stirrer was exchanged by a Turbomix TM, applying a constant G∙t-value of 25 000. Additionally, the angle of the blades of the flocculation stirrer was changed, almost doubling the G-value (154 1/s.) Long term trials have shown that an average TP effluent concentration of 60 μg/L can be achieved through microsieve filtration (10 μm) with chemical pretreatment (2.0 mg Al/L PACl and 0.61 mg/L cationic polymer). 80 % of the grab samples had a TP concentration ≤ 73 μg/L. An average effluent suspended solid concentration of 2.2 mg/L was achieved. The average residual Aluminum concentration was 0.35 mg/L. The increase of the G-value during coagulation and flocculation after the rebuild led to an increased energy demand of both stirrers. However, through the new hydraulic conditions, the average polymer dose was reduced by 65 % in comparison to the dynamic operation in summer 2011 and the hydraulic retention time during coagulation could be reduced to 1 minute at peak flow. Furthermore, the impact of applied energy during coagulation and flocculation was investigated. A reduction of the G∙t-value during coagulation led to a higher SS effluent concentration of 25 % (2.8 mg/L). During flocculation a high G-value (153 1/s) was favorable for the microsieve performance. A lower backwash time and effluent turbidity were observed. As a result, the increased energy demand of the stirrers can be justified, alongside to the polymer and hydraulic retention time reduction, with an improved effluent water quality and a lower energy demand for the backwash. The UV-disinfection operated reliably after the microsieve filtration. The UV effluent concentration of Enterococci and E.Coli were always under the limit of quantification (15-38 MPN/100 mL), even at a fluence of 361 J/m². Coliphages (≤ 7 PFU/100 mL) were detected in the effluent of the UVdisinfection, when the calculated fluence was lower than 549 J/m². In this study it was demonstrated that the microsieve filtration with chemical pretreatment and a subsequent UV-disinfection represents an alternative as tertiary treatment. TP effluent values lower than 80 μg/L were reliably achieved. An excellent water quality accordingly to the EG Bathing Water Quality Framework Directive was attained through the subsequent UV-disinfection.},

   year = {2011},
   abstract = {The redox environment is of utmost importance for the removal of organic compounds during artificial recharge. Within the research project OXIRED-2 five laboratory sand column experiments with natural sediments from the Lake Tegel infiltration pond and with microsieved surface water from Lake Tegel (Berlin) were performed to study the possibility to control the redox environment. Special emphasis was given to the sediments, the set-up of the column experiments, and the contact time within the column. The sediment was used either untreated or heated to 200°C or 550°C to study the effect of activation of organic carbon at 200°C and the effect of at least partial removal of natural organic carbon at 550°C. Additionally, an artificially produced iron coated sand was used for a two-layer experiment to increase the residence time of compounds susceptible to sorption within a given redox zone. Results reveal an immediate decrease of oxygen content at the outflow of the column in every experiment. Likewise, the redox potential also dropped significantly and immediately after the experiments started. However, the redox potential was significantly lower (approximately – 200 mV) in the experiments with the untreated or slightly heated sediments, and higher (about + 300 mV) for the experiment with the sediment heated up to 550°C. The redox zones known in natural environments developed also within the experiments even down to sulfate reduction at experiment No. 2. Ozonation of the influent water did not change the redox environment at the outflow of the column indicating a high reduction capacity of the natural sediment in the column within the duration of the experiments of up to 19 days. A constant input of ozone and an extended duration of the experiments might lead to a depletion of organic carbon in the sand column which could increase the redox potential. However, a complete depletion of organic carbon is very unlikely for managed aquifer recharge systems. The two-layer experiment with natural sand and artificially produced iron coated sands revealed that the iron coated sands had no influence on the redox system and only slight effect on the transport of ions. However, combining layers with different functionality might show great opportunities for designing and controlling redox systems especially with specific residence times in different redox zones for certain compounds in mind.},

   abstract = {Wet weather discharges from urban catchments are widely recognised as a major cause of unsatisfactory receiving water quality. Among stormwater discharges the impact from combined sewer overflows (CSO) plays a prominent role. The dynamic character of the discharge events lead to particular stress on the water bodies. Legal requirements for CSO follow the precautionary principle and usually set emission standards. Within the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC of May 1991 it is written that “member states shall decide on measures to limit pollution from storm water overflows”. The directive does not give standards but solely proposes that “such measures could be based on dilution rates or capacity in relation to dry weather flow, or could specify a certain acceptable number of overflows per year”. The European Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC of October 2000 goes beyond and asks for a combined approach to river basin management. On the source side, it requires that all existing technology-driven source-based controls must be implemented as a first step. On the effects side, it provides a new overall objective of good status for all waters, and requires that where the measures taken on the source side are not sufficient to achieve these objectives, additional ones are required. To assess the impact of CSO on the Berlin receiving water the research projects MONITOR and SAM-CSO are carried out in cooperation between Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe and the Senate Department of Environment Berlin. The objective of the projects is to identify and make available receiving water parameters (immission parameters) for the decision making process concerning the optimisation of the urban drainage system. Further on, a method for the evaluation of measures of combined water treatment on the basis of these immission criteria will be defined. The evaluation shall be based on both, available measurement data from the sewer system and the receiving water and simulations with an integrated model for the coupled drainage-river-system. The paper will present the methodology of the project. Special focus is on the description of the processes within the Berlin water bodies (stagnant lowland rivers) and the compilation of relevant physical-chemical and ecological parameters for the assessment of CSO.},

   abstract = {Real-time control of urban drainage systems allows activating capacities of storm water storage and wastewater treatment that were not used before. The historically developed structure of the Berlin combined sewerage, along with its aforementioned properties, allows per se a systematic management of the sub-systems. In the course of rehabilitation works the implementation of local regulators already opened additional storage reserves. Additionally, the potential of global control concepts for sewerage, pump stations and treatment plants is studied within the framework of the project “Integrated Sewage Management” to increase the systems efficiency. Especially, a coordination of the currently locally controlled pump stations entails a reduction of sewer overflows and hence an enhanced protection of the environment. For the catchment of wwtp Berlin-Ruhleben an integrated model of the collection system, pump stations, pressurised mains and the wwtp itself has been built up in order to evaluate different scenarios of global pump station control in comparison to a local control scenario (reference). Special attention was paid to the discharges from CSOs. Due to the high dynamic of these events and the high fraction of biodegradable organic substrate within the effluents, the impact on the water body over this path plays an important role. Concerning CSOs a maximum reduction of 14 % (COD load) and 20 % (TKN load) could be achieved. In conclusion it can be stated that a reduction of total emissions from the sewage system can be achieved by operating the pump stations in a global control mode. Furthermore, the main improvement can be observed for the discharges from combined sewer overflows.},

A preliminary assessment of the sewage system and the analysis of historical operational data showed a high potential concerning global real-time control of the pump stations. Three different global control scenarios have been studied on the basis of a long time simulation over 50 days and compared with a local control regime. The results show that the coordinated operation leads to a reduction of total emissions. Main improvements can be achieved concerning the discharges from combined sewer overflows.

This process changes the soluble COD into particulate COD which is better separate from the wastewater during the following step with coagulation, flocculation and micro sieve filtration. Goals were 95% removal of suspended solids and 80% of COD extracted through separation. To check these new scheme performances, a pilot plant (0.5 to 3 m³/h) was operated at the Stahnsdorf WWTP in the south of Berlin. First results showed that a HRT of 20-30 min and a load 40-60 g CODf /(m2*d) can be recommended for maximum accumulation and minimum oxidation and that the 80% of COD extraction can be achieved (at low oxygen concentration below 1 mg/L). However the performance difference between the scheme with or without MBBR did not exceed 8 %},

Especially in cities dominated by separated sewer systems, stormwater runoff containing micropollutants from anthropogenic origin is discharged mostly untreated into surface waters and therefore a potential source of high loads of pollutants. In a one year monitoring campaign stormwater runoff from five different catchments in Berlin is analyzed for major groups of micropollutants such as phthalates, organophosphates, organotin-compounds, biocides/pesticides, PAH’s, alkylphenols, polybrominated diphenylether, polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals. Sampling sites are equipped with automatic samplers, flow and water level meters in order to prepare flow proportional composite samples (recommended sampling strategy according to DIN ISO 5667-10). First results show that all groups of micropollutants were found in at least one catchment type in concentrations > 2 µg/L. Concentrations of the different micropollutant groups vary depending on the catchment types. So far, no organotin-compounds, polybrominated diphenylether or polychlorinated biphenyls were determined.},

Nevertheless questions remain concerning the runoff quality for nutrients and herbicides used against root penetration. In this study monitoring is conducted on two 18 year old green and gravel roofs comparing runoff quality based on concentrations and substance loads. The results indicate that runoff concentrations do not differ for total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP). Nitrate (NO3N) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations are clearly reduced by the green roof (TN green roof: 1.14 mg/L, gravel roof: 2.99 mg/L, n=7), given plant uptake of atmospheric nitrogen. In contrast, organic indicators chemical oxygen demand (COD green roof: 28.1 mg/L, gravel roof: 16.1 mg/L, n=11) and total organic nitrogen (TON) are higher in green roof runoff, possibly from soil leaching. However, total substance loads for 11 sampled storm events are lower by a factor of 0.8 to 0.2 (TSS, COD, TP, TN, TON) for of the green roof compared to the gravel roof, given their different hydraulic behaviours. Regarding herbicides, Mecoprop is still found in relevant concentrations from 0.08 to 6.59 µg/L in the green roof runoff, exceeding the EU threshold for pesticides in surface water bodies of 0.1 µg/L.},

In this study, the effect of several pre-treatment options before tertiary membrane treatment was investigated with a submicron particle counter from Nanosight (UK). This device using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis method is able to measure the particle size distribution and the absolute particle concentration of particles between 50 and 1000 nm in secondary effluent. The goal of this study is to enhance the understanding of MF/UF membrane fouling by monitoring the submicron particle fraction in the water. Experiments were carried out at lab-scale. Reliability and reproducibility of the device were determined as well as the impact of the pre-filtration on the measurements. The impact of ozonation (0-15 mg O3/L) and/or coagulation (0-12 mg Fe3+/L) on particle size distribution and on the filtration performance was studied on a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. Results showed a clear relationship between the amount of nanoparticles below 200 nm and the filtration behavior. Lower particle concentrations in this size range resulted in lower flux decline due to reversible fouling. Coagulation and ozonation pre-treatment decreased the particle concentration below 200 nm. The combination of ozonation/coagulation shows synergistic effects and leads to an additional decrease of submicron particle content and further improvement of the filtration performance. Long term impact on hydraulic irreversible fouling still needs to be clarified.},

Neben den Vorteilen eines kleinen Flächenbedarfs und eines verlässlichen Betriebes, birgt vor allem die hohe Ablaufqualität das Potential, die aufnehmenden Gewässer zu entlasten. Ein großes Problem beim Einsatz solcher Membranen ist das Membranfouling. Dieses führt zur raschen Abnahme der Filtrationsleistung, zur Erhöhung der Reinigungsfrequenz und des Chemikalieneinsatzes, was insgesamt hohe Betriebskosten verursacht. Sowohl gelöste organische Stoffe, als auch kolloidale und partikuläre Wasserinhaltsstoffe wurden als Hauptverursacher des Foulings von Niederdruckmembranen identifiziert. Durch gezielte Vorbehandlungen des Wassers kann das Membranfouling deutlich reduziert werden. Verschiedene Studien zeigen, dass eine vorgeschaltete Flockung zur Ausbildung eines porösen, hydraulisch gut rückspülbaren Filterkuchens führt. Weiterhin konnte gezeigt werden, dass eine Kombination aus Ozonung und Flockung durch den Effekt der Mikroflockung eine Bildung größerer, stabilerer Flocken bewirkt und somit eine verbesserte Filtrierbarkeit des Wassers erreicht werden kann. Bisher fehlt jedoch die Möglichkeit, verlässliche Vorhersagen über das Foulingpotential von gereinigtem Abwasser zu treffen. Das Ziel dieser Studie ist es, auf Grundlage von Partikelgrößenanalysen im nm-Bereich, Abschätzungen über das Foulingverhalten von Kläranlagenablauf zu treffen. Darauf aufbauend soll die Vorbehandlung aus Ozonung und anschließender Flockung für die Minimierung des Foulingpotenzials der im Wasser enthaltenen Substanzen optimiert werden.},

Diese Simulation erfolgt mit der Software HYDRAX und ist die Grundlage für die Simulation der Gewässergüteprozesse, die dann mit der Software QSIM durchgeführt wird. Da bisher im Rahmen des Projektes eine Gewässergütesimulation lediglich für den September 2005 erfolgte (Fokus auf 2 Starkregenereignisse mit Mischwasserüberlauf), konnten noch keine allgemeinen Aussagen zur Güte der Simulation des Gewässerbasiszustandes über längere Zeiträume getroffen werden. Die Simulation des Basiszustandes (unter Vernachlässigung der Mischwassereinleitungen) und die Anpassung des Modells an die Berliner Gewässerverhältnisse ist ein wichtiger Schritt, bevor die spezifische Situation während Mischwasserüberlauf betrachtet werden kann. Zusammenfassend ist festzuhalten, dass nach Korrektur der Zuflüsse über die Spree eine in Bezug auf den Referenzpegel Sophienwerder stimmige Durchflussbilanz erreicht werden konnte. Die aufgrund der instationären Berechnung verbleibende Bilanzdifferenz spiegelt gut das (im Vergleich zu den Stauhaltungen Mühlendamm/Kleinmachnow, Spandau oder Brandenburg mit ihren großen Seen) geringe Retentionsvermögen der Stauhaltung Charlottenburg wider. Unter Berücksichtigung der Messunsicherheit werden auch die Wasserstände für alle Durchflussverhältnisse in guter, für die anschließende Gütesimulation mit mehr als hinreichender Genauigkeit, berechnet. Hingewiesen sei darauf, dass bei einer Änderung der Zuflusssumme, z.B. durch die Berücksichtigung der bisher inaktiv gesetzten Mischwassereinleitungen, auch ein erneuter Bilanzausgleich vorgenommen werden sollte, da der Stauhaltung derzeit die vernachlässigten Größen indirekt über die Korrektur der Spreezuflüsse im Rahmen des Bilanzausgleichs zufließen.

   abstract = {The objective of the studies performed in the scope of the Integrated Sewage Management (ISM) project on combined sewer overflows in Berlin, Germany was to develop methods that would make it possible to assess wastewater management measures performed under the city’s water management permit as well as more sophisticated strategies (e.g., global real time control) through the application of water body-related criteria. For this purpose, a preliminary study was first performed to characterize the underlying  water body-specific processes and hydraulic, physical, chemical and ecological parameters relevant to the status of Berlin’s surface waters (LESZINSKI et al., 2007a). The second step involved the development of a method for water quality-oriented assessment of wastewater management measures (LESZINSKI ET AL., 2007b). In addition to the already recognized thresholds for dissolved oxygen concentration during continuous, long-term water load conditions, particular focus was placed on formulating requirements for oxygen demand under peak load conditions. Ammonia toxicity due to sewage input, another important stress factor for aquatic ecosystems, was also analyzed and threshold values for both chronic and acute peak ammonia loads were defined. The results of the third phase of this research are described in this report. Two numerical simulation models (for urban drainage networks and surface waters) were combined and the feasibility of the developed method was evaluated based on the case of a combined sewer overflow event documented by the surface water monitoring. The simulations were performed using InfoWorksTM CS hydrological/hydrodynamic urban drainage network modeling software (ISM model) and the GERRIS/HYDRAX/Qsim unsteady ecosystem modeling system. The latter model was developed by the Federal Institute of Hydrology in Koblenz and is used by the Senate Department of Health, Environment and Consumer Protection (SenGesUmV). The present report describes the theoretical principles of the utilized models, the base of data available for analysis of the selected event, and the assumptions made in cases of missing input data for hydraulic modeling as well as for the water quality simulations. The one-dimensional hydraulic modeling results for the branched surface water system of the reach Berlin-Charlottenburg demonstrated that the hydraulic conditions can be simulated with satisfactory accuracy using the current data. In the case of water temperature, it was also possible to achieve a high degree of agreement between the measured and computed values in spite of the lack of highresolution temporal input data from the tributaries (Landwehr Canal, Panke River, BerlinSpandau Ship Canal). However, this was not the case for dissolved oxygen concentration, the main parameter used for evaluation of combined water treatment. The DOC simulations computed using input data based on a monthly sampling interval did not show satisfactory agreement with the online measurements in the water system. Dry-weather biological processes, which were associated with high-level, short-term oxygen enrichment or consumption, could not be depicted in the simulations. After completion of the water quality simulations, the effect of variation of individual input parameters was assessed. This analysis showed that no significant improvement of agreement with the measured values could be achieved by adjusting the assumptions for individual parameters (chlorophyll-a and BSB5). In the case of ammonia, the second most important parameter, the available sampling data from the tributaries in the investigated water system were collected only once a month, if at all. Therefore, it cannot be expected that the temporal distribution of this parameter was correctly reflected by the model. The number of validation measurements taken within the water system was also insufficient. Summarizing the results of the study of the linked urban drainage/surface water quality model, which was tested for the first time, it can be concluded that InfoWorks CS and GERRIS/HYRDRAX/Qsim provide problem-oriented simulation tools for reaching the objective of ISM study of assessing various scenarios for reduction of impacts from combined sewer overflows. By contrast, the available data are deficient and do not allow to adjust and calibrate the models to meet the specific needs of this task, particularly in light of the fact that short-term effects of combined sewer overflows are to be analyzed.},

   abstract = {During the ISM study in the year 2007 first water quality simulations of the Berlin river Spree (stretch Charlottenburg) under consideration of combined sewer overflows (CSO) from the drainage system had been carried out. The period of September 2005 was simulated. A good correlation of simulation results with water quality measurements could only be observed for those days where the model boundary conditions were clearly defined (spot samples at the inflowing streams). However, these spot samples are carried out only once a month. Given the simulation period of one month and the temporal resolution of 15 minutes this data availability for the inflowing streams is not sufficient. Even more, some parameters had to be assessed entirely since no measurements were available. The data situation was especially critical for the inflow of the Landwehrkanal into the river Spree. No continuous measurement data was available for the following parameters: water temperature, oxygen content, pH and conductivity. For these parameters hydrographs had been assumed according to those at gauge Mühlendammschleuse with an offset calculated by the difference between the spot sampling at Landwehrkanal and the continuous values at Mühlendammschleuse. Furthermore, during the simulations within the ISM study a second storm event with overflows could not be considered since the simulation of the drainage system (software INFOWORKS CS) carried out by Berliner Wasserbetriebe was not yet available. The objective of the water quality simulations carried out within SAM-CSO was to take into account the full boundary conditions for the Landwehrkanal (continuous data now available). By comparison with the former simulation results the relevance of the inflow Landwehrkanal on the processes in the river Spree is shown. A second simulation was carried out with meteorological data of high temporal resolution. Former simulations were conducted with daily averages for e.g. air temperature, wind speed, etc. The influence of the temporal resolution of the input data on the diurnal hydrographs of different water quality parameters was analysed (focus on water temperature and dissolved oxygen). Finally, for the last simulation the data for the additional CSO event on 16-17 September 2005 was used (simulated by Berliner Wasserbetriebe with INFOWORKS CS). The results show that considering meteorological data of high temporal resolution and continuous data for the boundary condition Landwehrkanal have a significant influence on the quality of the water quality simulation results for river Spree, especially for the parameters oxygen content, pH and conductivity. Now, for September 2005 simulation results are available that are based on the best set of data that is currently available for the studied river stretch.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2012},
   abstract = {Continuous and quasi-continuous odour monitoring solutions have the potential to provide essential tools to support the whole odour control procedure in sewer networks. Hence, there is a need for continuous measurement and supervision of odour emissions with technical measurement systems. Objective of this investigation is the identification of instruments on the market which have the potential to be applied for odour monitoring from wastewater collection systems or wastewater treatment works. Generally one can distinguish between following methods of odour measurement: (i) Sensory methods: Measurement of odour concentration by olfactometry (evaluation by human noses), (ii) Analytical methods: (ii a) Selected sensors: Measurement of specific single odorants or surrogate parameters (e.g. H2S-measurement) (ii b). Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, optical sensors: Measurement or quantification of a spectrum of several gas components, (ii c) Multigas-sensor arrays: Measurement of overall odour parameters by means of unspecific, broadband multigas-sensor arrays. Only the mentioned analytical methods provide the possibility of continuous measurements. They however do not all consider the sensory component of odour (perceived effect). Within this report methods (ii b) and (ii c) will be covered. The report provides an introduction to the principle of measurement, briefly discussing examples of sampling methods and data analysis methods and gives lists of collected odour monitoring systems, tabulary providing specifications from literature, manufactures and vendors.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},

   abstract = {The overall project WellMa, which stands for well management, aims at the optimization of the operation and maintenance of drinking water abstraction wells. For this purpose, in addition to a statistical analyses of well data (report D 1.2) and first field investigations to compare various diagnosis methods (report D 1.3), a review of literature during the preparatory phase WellMa1 should answer the following questions: (1) Which processes affecting the well performance and conditions can occur? (2) Which correlation exists between well ageing and well characteristics? (3) How can such well ageing be recognized at an early stage? (4) What is the state of the practice to restore a good performance and condition? (5) What can be done during well design and construction to prevent well ageing? (6) How can well operation be adjusted to slow-down well ageing processes? Based on textbooks, standards and professional articles published in large number since the middle of the nineties, the state of the art was gathered and compared to current practice at BWB and Veolia to identify possibilities for improvement and specify the need for further investigations to be proposed for WellMa2. 1) Three well ageing types involving different processes could be identified. These are chemical, biological and physical clogging. They are closely linked to the characteristics of the exploited aquifer, such as the physical properties of the formation or the chemical composition of the groundwater. 2) The evaluation of these site-specific aquifer characteristics, the impacts from well design and the observed effects on the well performance and condition and their development with time of operation should be used to specify the individual ageing potential for each well site. 3) The early recognition of well ageing implies the need to monitor wells (1) regularly and (2) with comparable methods. As suitable indicators, the development of water levels and discharge rates to calculate the specific drawdown and specific capacity, the pump surveillance and the visible condition of the well interior could be identified. 4) Both, the assessment of the ageing potential and the monitoring of a reference value describing the state of the well lead to the specification of maintenance requirements. Generally, three strategies could be identified, ranging from sheer operation, over reactive maintenance to regular condition assessment and preventive treatment. Concerning the choice of maintenance method, key criteria must always be the well design, its state of construction, the well ageing type and location. Up to now, patterns linking well characteristics and the success of maintenance could not be identified. Thus, maintenance relies on practical experience and the willingness to discuss limitations and disadvantages of methods as open as the advantages on side of the rehabilitation companies. 5) For well design and construction, the technical standards were summarized, describing the necessary steps for proper dimensioning, drilling, choice of materials and final well development. Not only the avoidance of nonconformities and the careful evaluation of the advantages, but also the restrictions of different well design alternatives, e.g. for the accessibility of rehabilitation, assure an optimal well ageing prevention and well operation. 6) Furthermore, well operation could be identified as a key element and critical factor codetermining the lifetime, but at the same time the economic efficiency of a well. It is always a compromise between demand, technical possibilities and economic considerations, for which reason general standards or technical guidance are not available so far. They need to be developed individually considering present well ageing processes and the quantification of impacts. Comparing the state of the art with current practice at BWB and Veolia, room for improvement could primarily be identified for monitoring and subsequent data processing for both, operational parameters (to assess well performance and condition), and maintenance (to evaluate the success of applied treatments). Based on the recommendations derived on this state of the art review, within WellMa2 the effects of measures for preventing and treating well ageing shall be quantified so that the benefits can be assessed for future optimized well management.},

Aim of the WELLMA-DSS is to provide site-specific decision support for the diagnosis and monitoring of ageing processes within drinking water abstraction wells and their operation and maintenance. Thus, it contains (i) an indication of the current condition of the well from its ageing potential and current condition of the aquifer, well and pump, (ii) an assessment of the ageing potential for six pre-defined ageing types in wells, (iii) early-warning and pre-diagnosis, and (iv) recommendations for economic considerations when planning well regenerations. After applying the WELLMA-DSS tool to a given set of data for a drinking water abstraction well, the user should be enabled to recognize (1) what kind of deterioration is to be expected based on given site conditions and well construction properties, (2) what is the current condition of the aquifer, well and pump, (3) which parameters should be monitored and why and (4) which Qs would be needed to be reached with a planned regeneration given cost and operation parameters. The WELLMA-DSS manual at hand contains a description of the graphical user interfaces to explain the handling and application of the tool. All data processing and calculation steps are detailed in a separate WELLMA-DSS documentation containing both, a process description (scientific part) and the technical documentation of tables, forms and technical implementation of the identified processes (technical part).},

   abstract = {Approximately 70% of the drinking water in Germany (BGR) and about 50% worldwide (IGREC 2011) are abstracted from groundwater using filter wells. Their implementation, operation and maintenance are major factors contributing to the costs of drinking water production. According to an international survey (Howsam, Misstear & Jones 1995 ), 40% of worldwide used water abstraction wells work inefficiently in terms of well performance or water quality. This implies high costs and a great potential for improvement, both for the (re-) construction of new wells (capital investment) and well operation (energy consumption, maintenance needs). The main reason for inefficient well performance is so-called well ageing, i.e. the decrease in performance due to biological, chemical and / or physical processes in and around the well. Dominant factors determining type, extension and location of deposits are the geology of the exploited aquifer together with the qualitative properties of the abstracted water, the well design (dimensions and materials), construction (drilling method) and operation. The project WellMa, initiated and financed by the Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) and Veolia Eau, and coordinated at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB), aimed at improving the efficiency of drinking water abstraction wells by identifying, evaluating and testing methods of well management including design, operation and maintenance to slow down well ageing. Set into relation to ranges, in which ageing processes are known to occur, the initial data of well sites were used to differentiate a low, medium or high potential for the occurrence of well ageing and to define the monitoring needs accordingly. Well ageing processes were distinguished into six types, each of them implying different pre-requisites and site conditions and leading to different monitoring and/ or maintenance requirements. For carbonate scaling, iron ochre formation, biofouling, corrosion, colmation and sand intake pre-requisites, triggers and threshold conditions were identified and implemented in a decision support system enabling well operators to prioritize the needs for monitoring, diagnosis or maintenance action taking into account the specific well and site characteristics.},

Their implementation and operation are major factors contributing to the costs of drinking water production. Within the joint research project ANTIOCKER , funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education, and coordinated at the Dept. of Applied Microbiology of the Technical University Berlin, the partners Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) and the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (KWB) focus on the efficient operation of drinking water abstraction wells. One major reason for inefficient wells is so-called well ageing, i.e. the increase in drawdown at constant discharge rate due to biological, chemical and / or physical processes in and around the well. In Berlin, approximately 80% of clogging deposits are described to be of biochemical nature involving iron-related bacteria. Previous studies, i.e. in the scope of the KWB research project WELLMA have revealed that such well ageing phenomena are determined by multiple correlated biological and chemical processes. For this reason, it is the sound understanding of the main processes and key parameters that will provide the basis for the systematic control of iron bacteria occurrence by an optimized well operation. A new approach to a large variety of data from well construction and maintenance of the Berlin drinking water wells focused on the determination of key parameters for monitoring and the identification of hidden variables for ageing by means of probabilistic statistics. Cumulative distribution plots are used to visualize large data amounts and frequency distribution plots filter correlations between e.g. maintenance events in the lifetime of a well and monitoring data.  First results indicate that small changes in the discharge rate Q on a daily basis could be used to monitor the well performance on a much higher frequency than the currently used evaluation of the specific capacity. In addition, the electric conductivity proved to be a key variable for clogging. Both parameters are now being verified in field investigations and further data analyses within the research project ANTIOCKER and about 50% worldwide are abstracted 2 from groundwater using filter wells. Their implementation and operation are major factors contributing to the costs of drinking water production.},

The main reason for inefficient well performance is so-called well ageing. Deposit formation due to multiply correlated biological, chemical and/ or physical clogging processes in and around the well cause a decrease in performance. Thus, the interdisciplinary WELLMA-project team aimed at improving the efficiency of drinking water production wells by providing a scientific basis to support operators in their efforts to reduce well ageing. This included the development of guidance and recommendations for an adapted and well-planned operation scheme and maintenance strategy to sustain or reinstall the well performance. Well ageing processes were intensively studied at a multitude of vertical drinking water production wells located in Berlin, Germany and near Bordeaux, France. Thereby, classical monitoring and diagnosis methods, such as pumping tests and TV inspections, but also newly developed own experimental setups, such as the in-situ measurement of oxygen, depth-oriented water sampling or the exposure of object slides and bio-reactors for biofilm growth were applied. This synthesis report follows the project outline featuring four work packages dealing with (i) the identification of ageing types and the site-specific ageing potential from optimal data processing of site and well characteristics to provide decision support for the diagnosis and subsequent optimisation of well operation, monitoring and maintenance, (ii) field methods and experimental setups applied within the WELLMA-project to investigate mixing processes, oxygen uptake and biofilm formation, (iii) the impacts of intermittent operation on the uptake potential and distribution patterns of oxygen, and (iv) the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide treatments for preventive well maintenance against biochemically induced iron ochre formation and the oxygen uptake potential correlated to the decomposition of H2O2. Intermediate data were presented at various occasions at scientific and practiceoriented conferences, e.g. the Association for General and Applied Microbiology (VAAM), the International Water Association (IWA) Groundwater conference, International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH), Berlin-Brandenburger Brunnentage, Wasser Berlin etc. and in related papers. A publication list is given at the end of this synthesis report.},

   abstract = {The assessment of methods for the diagnosis and distinction of well ageing types and processes with the aim to recommend methods and tools for further fieldwork was part of work package 1 of the preparatory phase WellMa1. Therefore, field tests were carried out at selected well sites with a variety of methods covering standard monitoring methods to assess the constructive state of a well (TV inspections, borehole geophysical methods) and its performance (pump tests) as well as methods aiming at a better process understanding such as the hydrochemical and microbiological analysis of the raw water and clogging deposits. Altogether ten methods were applied at 21 different wells of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) covering (i) exposure of object slides during operation and rest periods for microbiological investigations, (ii) BART with test kits for iron-related bacteria (IRB) and slime-forming bacteria (SLYM), (iii) water sampling for the investigation of pristine groundwater organisms, (iv) online measurements of chemical parameters O2, Eh, pH and T and water sampling for chemical analyses (main cations and anions), (v) TV inspections, (vi) three-step pumping tests, (vii) borehole geophysics with Gamma-Gamma-Density scan (GG.D), NeutronNeutron log (NN), Flowmeter (Flow) and Packer-Flowmeter measurement and (ix) Particle countings. The assessment and comparison should originally be completed by a horizontally directed core sampling from different depths from the screen sections of three of the chosen wells. Due to technical difficulties, this was not achieved during this phase of the project. The investigations led to a development and refinement of the methods and approaches. Because of their limited accessibility to the different parts of a well, a combination of methods is always necessary. Especially for the indirect methods like borehole geophysics, an initial assessment of the well condition directly subsequent to construction is essential to provide a basis for the assessment of the well performance development. Generally, the applied standard monitoring methods and diagnosis tools provided the expected identification of a performance deterioration and evidence for the presence of starting materials for clogging processes such as iron, oxygen, iron-related bacteria and particles. Room for improvement could be identified with regard to the reliability, information value and comparability of the tested methods, e.g. by a stepwise combination and extension of the methods to determine the interacting processes from the composition of the deposits. Further investigations should aim at method validation, especially for well monitoring during routine operation (e.g. use of delta h, development of standards for Qs-measurements and TV inspections), and further method development for the ongoing project with scientific investigations to obtain deeper process understanding, e.g. investigating shares of deposits resulting from the different processes (chemical, biological, physical) and relations between the rate of clogging or the location of deposits to well characteristics and site conditions to separate the different well ageing processes. This will then lead to the identification of key parameters that may be influenced to slow down well ageing and keep the well performance and water quality at an optimum.},

Die Temperaturmessung erfolgte kontinuierlich mittels Datenloggern in Entnahmebrunnen und Grundwassermessstellen und zusätzlich manuell bei wöchentlichen Probenahmen. Zeitreihen konservativer Tracer (Chlorid, Bromid, δ18O und δ2H) dienten der Validierung der aus den Temperaturmessungen bestimmten thermischen Retardations- und Dispersionskoeffizienten. Trotz signifikanter Unterschiede zwischen den beiden untersuchten Standorten erwiesen sich die Temperaturmessungen als geeignetes Instrument zur Bestimmung der Verweilzeiten.

   abstract = {In Berlin wird Trinkwasser ohne aufwändige technische Aufbereitung über naturnahe Verfahren gewonnen. Ca. 80% des geförderten Rohwassers stammen aus Uferfiltration oder künstlich angereichertem Grundwasser (Möller & Burgschweiger 2008). Nach der Entfernung von Eisen und Mangan über Belüftung und Filtration wird im Routinebetrieb grundsätzlich auf eine chemische Desinfektion verzichtet. Zur Gewährleistung der hygienischen Sicherheit haben die Wasserschutzgebiete und hier insbesondere die engere Schutzzone (Zone II) daher eine wichtige Bedeutung. Deren Ausdehnung reicht von der Fassungsanlage bis zu der Linie, von der aus das genutzte Grundwasser 50 Tage im Grundwasserleiter fließt, bevor es über Brunnen zum Wasserwerk gefördert wird (DVGW 2006). Durch die Einhaltung dieser 50-Tage-Richtlinie wird v.a. der Schutz vor mikrobiellen Verunreinigungen angestrebt. Die Aufenthaltszeit des Wassers in der Untergrundpassage kann direkt durch Markierungsversuche ermittelt werden. Da solche Tracer-Untersuchungen zeitlich und technisch aufwändig sind, wurde im Rahmen verschiedener gemeinsamer Forschungsprojekte der Berliner Wasserbetriebe und des Kompetenzzentrums Wasser Berlin geprüft, mit welchen einfachen, kostengünstigen Methoden die Fließzeiten und die Auswirkungen sich ändernder klimatischer Randbedingungen im Betrieb der Grundwasseranreicherung und der Trinkwasserbrunnen überwacht werden können (Sprenger et al. 2016). Dabei wurden unter anderem kontinuierlich messende Temperatur-Druck-Sonden eingesetzt, sowie Geräte zur Quasi-Echtzeitmessung mikrobiologischer Parameter. Parallel wurde für einen Wasserwerksstandort in Berlin ein vereinfachtes numerisches Modell erstellt, mit dem Anreicherungsszenarien in Abhängigkeit der Temperatur des angereicherten Wassers gerechnet und bewertet werden können. Außerdem wurde der Einfluss der Wassertemperatur auf betriebliche Parameter der Oberflächenwasseraufbereitung untersucht. Die Untersuchungen sind ebenfalls Grundlage für risikobasierte Bewertungsansätze für hydraulische und mikrobiologische Parameter und die Ableitung betrieblicher Maßnahmen gegen eine Unterschreitung der 50-Tage-Verweilzeit.},

   abstract = {The overall project WellMa, which stands for well management, aims at the optimization of the operation and maintenance of drinking water abstraction wells. For this purpose, in addition to a statistical analyses of well data (report D 1.2) and first field investigations to compare various diagnosis methods (report D 1.3), a review of literature during the preparatory phase WellMa1 should answer the following questions: (1) Which processes affecting the well performance and conditions can occur? (2) Which correlation exists between well ageing and well characteristics? (3) How can such well ageing be recognized at an early stage? (4) What is the state of the practice to restore a good performance and condition? (5) What can be done during well design and construction to prevent well ageing? (6) How can well operation be adjusted to slow-down well ageing processes? Based on textbooks, standards and professional articles published in large number since the middle of the nineties, the state of the art was gathered and compared to current practice at BWB and Veolia to identify possibilities for improvement and specify the need for further investigations to be proposed for WellMa2. 1) Three well ageing types involving different processes could be identified. These are chemical, biological and physical clogging. They are closely linked to the characteristics of the exploited aquifer, such as the physical properties of the formation or the chemical composition of the groundwater. 2) The evaluation of these site-specific aquifer characteristics, the impacts from well design and the observed effects on the well performance and condition and their development with time of operation should be used to specify the individual ageing potential for each well site. 3) The early recognition of well ageing implies the need to monitor wells (1) regularly and (2) with comparable methods. As suitable indicators, the development of water levels and discharge rates to calculate the specific drawdown and specific capacity, the pump surveillance and the visible condition of the well interior could be identified. 4) Both, the assessment of the ageing potential and the monitoring of a reference value describing the state of the well lead to the specification of maintenance requirements. Generally, three strategies could be identified, ranging from sheer operation, over reactive maintenance to regular condition assessment and preventive treatment. Concerning the choice of maintenance method, key criteria must always be the well design, its state of construction, the well ageing type and location. Up to now, patterns linking well characteristics and the success of maintenance could not be identified. Thus, maintenance relies on practical experience and the willingness to discuss limitations and disadvantages of methods as open as the advantages on side of the rehabilitation companies. 5) For well design and construction, the technical standards were summarized, describing the necessary steps for proper dimensioning, drilling, choice of materials and final well development. Not only the avoidance of nonconformities and the careful evaluation of the advantages, but also the restrictions of different well design alternatives, e.g. for the accessibility of rehabilitation, assure an optimal well ageing prevention and well operation. 6) Furthermore, well operation could be identified as a key element and critical factor codetermining the lifetime, but at the same time the economic efficiency of a well. It is always a compromise between demand, technical possibilities and economic considerations, for which reason general standards or technical guidance are not available so far. They need to be developed individually considering present well ageing processes and the quantification of impacts. Comparing the state of the art with current practice at BWB and Veolia, room for improvement could primarily be identified for monitoring and subsequent data processing for both, operational parameters (to assess well performance and condition), and maintenance (to evaluate the success of applied treatments). Based on the recommendations derived on this state of the art review, within WellMa2 the effects of measures for preventing and treating well ageing shall be quantified so that the benefits can be assessed for future optimized well management.},

   abstract = {Within the study “IC-Pharma” a graphical benchmark of the occurrence of 30 priority pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) covering different therapeutic classes such as analgesics, antibiotics, lipid lowering drugs, beta blockers, tranquilizers, and cytostatics in the urban water cycle was conducted. The results are based on an extensive data set collected during several monitoring campaigns in Berlin and the Canton Zurich. This benchmark of the occurrence of priority pharmaceuticals allows water practitioners from other sites to compare detected concentrations of priority PhACs in STP effluents, surface water and groundwater.
The study shows that the occurrence of priority pharmaceuticals at both study sites (Berlin and the Canton Zurich) is primarily dependent on sales/consumption quantities, the dilution of the pharmaceuticals in the waste water system and the dilution in surface water by the natural water flow. At both sites mainly conventional STP with mechanical treatment and biological treatment are in operation.
Major differences in the sales data of priority PhACs, the hydrological setting, the water supply and the sewage disposal of both study sites are presented. Comparing both study sites it can be observed that the rivers in the Canton Zurich in general have a higher natural water flow than the Berlin Rivers. Furthermore, instead of operating 6 large municipal STPs like Berlin does, the Canton Zurich operates 103 small public STPs. However, the annual volume of treated sewage at both sites is similar (~235 M m³/a). In Berlin the drinking water consumption per capita and day is 112 litres whereas the inhabitants in the Canton Zurich use approximately 160 litres per day.
These differences of both study sites are reflected in the detectable concentrations of measured priority PhACs in the different water compartments. In general lower levels of concentration (up to a factor ten) were found in all water compartments in the Canton Zurich. Therefore a separate graphical benchmark of the levels of concentration at the two study sites is presented so that the water practitioner has the possibility to refer either to the Berlin situation or the Canton Zurich situation.
For the Berlin site it was furthermore investigated how the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface water are correlated with the proportion of treated sewage. It can be observed that detectable median concentrations of priority PhACs tested in rivers or canals with a proportion of treated sewage higher than 30% are significantly higher (e.g. for the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole) than in rivers with a proportion of treated sewage less than 30%.},

If local information on important QMRA model inputs is missing, it is widely accepted to justify assumptions about these model inputs by using external literature information. A question, which remains unexplored, is the extent to which previously published external information should influence local estimates in cases of nonexistent, scarce, and moderate local data. This question can be addressed by employing Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM). Thus, we study the effects and potential benefits of BHM on risk and performance target calculations at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in comparison to alternative statistical modeling approaches (separate modeling, no-pooling, complete pooling). The treated wastewater from the WWTPs is used for restricted irrigation, potable reuse, or influences recreational waters, respectively. We quantify the extent to which external data affects local risk estimations in each case depending on the statistical modeling approach applied. Modeling approaches are compared by calculating the pointwise expected log-predictive density for each model. As reference pathogens and example data, we use locally collected Norovirus genogroup II data with varying sample sizes (n = 4, n = 7, n = 27), and complement local information with external information from 44 other WWTPs (n = 307). Results indicate that BHM shows the highest predictive accuracy and improves estimates by reducing parameter uncertainty when data are scarce. In such situations, it may affect risk and performance target calculations by orders of magnitude in comparison to using local data alone. Furthermore, it allows making generalizable inferences about new WWTPs, while providing the necessary flexibility to adjust for different levels of information contained in the local data. Applying this flexible technique more widely may contribute to improving methods and the evidence base for decision-making in future QMRA studies.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2015},
   abstract = {The Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling – Managed Aquifer Recharge provide a ready-to -use and user-friendly compendium of knowledge. Practical instructions and checklists provide a step wise approach with a strong focus on implementation. The proposed models for water flow and substance transport allow a first tier estimation of present concentrations in ambient groundwater and the impacted zone in the aquifer. The use of stochastic models is not mandatory within the guidelines. A criticism which can be identified related to the use of models simply based on point estimates, is that especially in early stage risk assessments, where uncertainties are usually high, these models tend to pretend a level of certainty which often does not represent reality. Risks associated to inorganic chemicals are required to be treated with more detail. Rigorous quantification of biodegradation kinetics (e.g. first-order rate constants) and adsorption parameters (e.g. linear distribution coefficients) for EOCs during subsurface passage determined on field scale are still scarce. It is clear that first-order rate constants and linear distribution coefficients provide only a simplified description of the removal mechanisms during subsurface passage, because they neglect spatial and temporal dynamics of physical and chemical conditions. Nevertheless, this approach often provides a good approximation and allows also for site independent comparison of removal processes. Regarding the demonstration site in Berlin-Tegel the analysis showed that if the model of the Australian Guidelines is applied to the MAR system the travel time of 50d during subsurface passage cannot be guaranteed. In Germany, a residence time of 50d is usually considered to sufficiently reduce the risk of microbial hazards. Although risk calculations did not reveal immediate concern, it is recommended to develop and apply suitable verification monitoring techniques to quantify travel times and reduce present uncertainties. Moreover, this risk assessment and the study about the influence of the groundwater replenishment site on ambient groundwater (Sprenger and Grützmacher, 2015) clearly showed the need for protective measures against the input of undesired substances from shallow ambient groundwater.},

In order to investigate the relevance of stormwater as a source of microbial contamination as well as the influence of catchment characteristics on the faecal loading, E.Coli, intestinal Enterococci and colony counts have been measured in event related stormwater samples of three different catchment areas in Berlin. The catchment areas were chosen to be as homogeneous as possible representing catchments of old housing buildings (OLD), new housing buildings (NEW), and commercial areas (COM). N-Formylaminoantipyrine (FAA) was measured as a tracer for raw wastewater. Results showed elevated concentrations (1-2 log units) of faecal indicator organisms (FIO) in catchment OLD (104-105 in comparison to 103 cfu/100mL) suggesting illicit connections of wastewater discharges to rainwater drains, which is supported by elevated concentrations of FAA in the same catchment type. This underlines the relevance of these illicit connections as a source of hygienic contamination, which has to be considered when planning urban bathing water activities.},

However, the BWD does not provide clearly defined threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning or informing the population. Statistical regression modelling is a commonly used method for predicting concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. The present study proposes a methodology for implementing early warning systems based on multivariate regression modelling, which takes into account the probabilistic character of European bathing water legislation for both alert levels and model validation criteria. Our study derives the methodology, demonstrates its implementation based on information and data collected at a river bathing site in Berlin, Germany, and evaluates health impacts as well as methodological aspects in comparison to the current way of long-term classification as outlined in the BWD.},

Several cities have identified the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) as an option to mitigate several challenges at once. However, can two different aims be reached with NBS in the same location? This question has not yet been addressed. This paper discusses the spatial compatibility of NBS implementation strategies to tackle (1) urban heat island (UHI) effects and (2) water pollution at the same location. The evaluation is based on a spatial analysis of Berlin. We found a positive correlation of high UHI and median high stormwater pollution loads for zinc, total suspended solids, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Terbutryn. Out of more than 14,000 building/street sections analyzed, 2270 showed spatial matching of high UHI and high stormwater pollution loads. In the majority of building/street sections, stormwater pollution was high for three out of the four parameters. We conclude that the compatibility of NBS implementation for both challenges depends both on the implementation strategies for NBS and on the specific NBS measures. Our spatial analysis can be used for further planning processes for NBS implementation.},

   abstract = {Um einen guten Gewässerschutz zu gewährleisten und die Europäische Wasserrahmenrichtlinie umzusetzen, sollten stofflich oft unterschätzte Niederschlagsabflüsse aus dem Trennsystem behandelt werden. Vor allem Straßenabflüsse von stark befahrenen Straßen, Kreuzungen und Abflüsse von viel genutzten Parkplatzflächen weisen eine hohe Schadstoffbelastung auf. Besonders im dicht besiedelten urbanen Raum ist eine zentrale Behandlung von Straßenabflüssen zum Beispiel mit Retentionsbodenfiltern oder Regenklärbecken mit Sedimentationswirkung aus Platzgründen nicht immer möglich. Um dennoch behandlungsbedürftiges Niederschlagswasser zu reinigen, stellen dezentrale Technologien eine Alternative dar. Es existieren unterschiedliche Anlagen auf dem Markt, welche auf dem Prinzip der Abscheidung durch Sedimentation, Filtration und Adsorption oder auf einer Kombinationen dieser Verfahren basieren. Am Fachgebiet Siedlungswasserwirtschaft der TU Berlin wird zur Zeit in enger Kooperation mit der Ingenieurgesellschaft Prof. Dr. Sieker mbh, dem Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin, den Berliner Wasserbetrieben und der Berliner Stadtreinigung das Projekt „Dezentrale Reinigung von Straßenabflüssen“ durchgeführt. Im Rahmen des Projekts werden verschiedene Technologien zur dezentralen Reinigung von Straßenabflüssen im öffentlichen Straßenraum in Berlin (Clayallee) sowie auf einem Betriebshof der Berliner Stadtreinigung untersucht. Dazu werden bereits vorhandene Schächte im Straßenraum umgerüstet bzw. neu errichtet und um zusätzliche Probenahmemöglichkeiten ergänzt und mit automatischen Messeinrichtungen ausgerüstet. Ferner erfolgt die Aufnahme betrieblicher Daten.. Parallel dazu wurde ein Teststand im Technikum des Instituts für Bauingenieurwesen der TU Berlin aufgebaut, an dem die dezentralen Systeme unter definierten und reproduzierbaren Bedingungen auf ihre hydraulische Leistungsfähigkeit und ihr stoffliches Rückhaltevermögen getestet werden.},

Combined sewer overflows (CSO) cause significant impacts on the water quality and their identification is crucial to plan CSO control programs or to fulfil legal requirements. This paper proposes and demonstrates six different methods to identify the occurrence of CSO based on information on the sewer system alone (methods 1 and 2), in combination with rain data (methods 3 and 4) or in combination with water quality data of the receiving surface water (methods 5 and 6). The methods provide different information on CSO, from occurrence to pollution load and impacts in receiving surface water. The methods introduced have all been applied to the Berlin urban water system. Based on these experiences they are compared considering the effort needed for their application, the required data and the obtained output. It is concluded that certainty of CSO identification can be increased by combining some of the presented methods.},

In the field of limnology, monitoring data are needed to assess the ecological status of water bodies and understand the bio-geochemical processes that affect this status. In wastewater management, measured or simulated data are the basis for planning and control of sewer networks. Given the importance of data in water-related research makes them a valuable resource, which should be handled in an adequate way. Based on experiences in data collection and data processing in water-related research this paper proposes – both from a computer scientist’s and an environmental engineer’s point of view – a set of rules for data handling: Rule 1: Protect raw data. Rule 2: Save metadata. Rule 3: Use databases. Rule 4: Separate data from processing. Rule 5: Use programming. Rule 6: Avoid redundancy. Rule 7: Be transparent. Rule 8: Use standards and naming conventions. Applying these rules (i) increases the quality of data and results, (ii) allows to prepare data for long-term usage and make data accessible to different people, (iii) makes data processing transparent and results reproducible, and (iv) saves – at least in the long run – time and effort. With this contribution the authors would like to start a discussion about best data handling practices and present a first checklist of data handling and data processing for practitioners and researchers working in the water sector.},

   year = {2008},
   abstract = {Within the project SAM-CSO it shall be tested if the Open Modelling Interface and Environment (OpenMI) can be applied to link models of the Berlin sewerage (modelled in the urban drainage software InfoWorks CS,Wallingford Software) to a river water quality model. This report gives an overview on the OpenMI and its application. Chapter 1 outlines the general background of integrated water management and integrated modelling as it is aimed at by the European Water Framework Directive. The development process, which resulted in the release of the OpenMI is summarized in chapter 2. An introduction to the objectives, the concept and the technology of the OpenMI is given in chapter 3. Chapter 4 lists case studies in which the OpenMI has been applied. In Appendix B, each of the reported studies has been described in generalized form. A matrix showing all model links, which have been established within the case studies, has been developed. Finally, in chapter 5, an overview on other model linking approaches is given. This report shows that in many use cases the Open Modelling Interface could be used successfully for model linking. Even out of Europe, at a workshop of the U.S. EPA it is stated that, in terms of the ability to go between different temporal and spatial scales, a framework such as OpenMI might have the necessary flexibility. Actually, it was found that in many cases models of the InfoWorks software family have been part of the OpenMI linked systems. In cases of many interaction points between models, the OpenMI mechanism may not be applicable. In the Berlin case the impact of combined sewer overflows on the water quality of the receiving river shall be examined. With far less than a hundred interaction points between sewer model and river model it is assumed that the OpenMI could be used for a successful model linking. The difficulty within the SAM-CSO project may be to find an apropriate river quality model, which is ready to be linked to InfoWorks CS using the OpenMI. Unfortunately, there are few use cases reported in which a freely available river water quality model was involved. The water quality model QSIM of the German Institute of Hydrology (BfG) that is used within the project is currently not equipped with OpenMI. Nevertheless, using the OpenMI mechanism for model linking is assumed to be a promising approach. It is expected to become an internationally accepted standard. As the OpenMI specification is fully free, anyone may contribute to its further development. The OpenMI Association will give advice to modellers and will be open to discussions on improvement of the OpenMI. With the OpenMI linking mechanism not only models can be linked. Modules for calibration, optimization, statistical evaluation etc. can be part of an OpenMI system as well as components for generic data access or visualization. It will be tested, if the integration of such a module for statistical evaluation into the CSO impact assessment method (to be developed within the project SAM-CSO) is applicable and useful.},

   abstract = {Combined sewer overflows (CSO) can have a strong impact on the quality of surface waters. A common measure to reduce CSO is the construction of storage tanks. The objective of this study was to determine the required volume of a storage tank by means of a numerical long-term simulation and to assess uncertain input data. Particularly, the influence of the considered rain series’ length on the calculated storage volume was investigated. Engineering standards usually recommend the use of at least 10 to 15 years of rain series. Here, the hydraulic behaviour of the studied sewer system was simulated in a 30 year hydrodynamic simulation. Special effort was made to calibrate an available model by use of currently measured data. The quality of calibration was evaluated by means of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient. The analysis of input data uncertainty revealed that applying a 10 year series results in tank volumes that differ between -12 % and +19 %, respectively from the dimensioning result achieved by applying the 30 year rain series.},

The combined sewer overflows are a very sensitive theme in Berlin because of the city’s drink water supply system. The Integrated Sewage Management project, materialized within the Berlin Water Competence Center, aims to optimize the network thanks to hydraulic and pollution modelling. The first step of this study is to model a pilot catchment’s area, thanks to the Hydroworks DM software. Beyond the network constitution, a measurement campaign is realized to calibrate the model, for hydraulic as well as for pollution processes. This has to be done for both dry and rain weather. A first calibration is made possible by the results of dry weather measurements. The analysis of rain weather measurements will allow the validation of the model to be done, and its transposition to the other Berlin catchment’s areas.},

   abstract = {Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a widely accepted method for augmenting water supplies for potable and non-potable use. The success of the MAR system is often defined by a substantial removal of chemical and biological contaminants during subsurface passage. To determine removal rates and to differentiate between removal and overall attenuation due to dilution, estimation of mixing proportions is a key element of tracer applications. This report provides an overview of tracers suitable for MAR and discusses advantages and disadvantages for each tracer. The ideal tracer may be defined by: a natural or anthropogenic origin, a clear uneven distribution in the studied system (e.g. sharp contrast between source and native groundwater), non-toxicity (human and environmental), easy and cost-effective measurement, and a conservative (neither sorbed nor (bio-)chemical reactive) or at least predictable chemical or physical behavior. A huge number of tracers exist, each with advantages and disadvantage. Tracers can be dissolved (e.g. chloride, bromide), stable or radioactive isotopes (e.g. 18O, 3H), gaseous (e.g. SF6) or a physical properties (e.g. temperature). The use of heat as a tracer has several advantages over hydrochemical tracers. Temperature is inexpensive, easy and a robust parameter to measure. In contrast to chemical tracers, no laboratory analysis is required and the data is available immediately. Finally, a multi tracer approach (≥ 2 tracers) is always recommended, because the ideal tracer is rarely found. A reasonable combination is at least one conservative tracer (e.g. stable isotopes of water) with a retarded tracer (e.g. temperature) to evaluate short travel times from the point of recharge (e.g. riverbed or pond) to the recovery well.},

   abstract = {Different types of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes are widely distributed and applied on various scales and for various purposes in the European countries, but a systematic categorization and compilation of data has been missing up to now. The European MAR catalogue presented herein contains various key parameters collected from the available literature. The catalogue includes 224 currently active MAR sites found in 23 European countries. Large quantities of drinking water are produced by MAR sites in Hungary, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Poland, Switzerland and France. This inventory highlights that, for over a century, MAR has played an important role in the development of European water supply and contributes to drinking-water production substantially. This development has occurred autonomously, with “trial-and-error” within the full range of climatically and hydrogeologically diverse conditions of the European countries. For the future, MAR has the potential to facilitate optimal (re)use and storage of available water resources and to take advantage of the natural purification and low energy requirements during MAR operations. Particularly with respect to the re-use of wastewater treatment-plant effluent and stormwater, which is currently underdeveloped, the use of MAR can support the public acceptance of such water-resource efficient schemes. Particularly for the highly productive and urbanized coastal zones, where the pressure on freshwater supplies increases by growing water demand, salinization and increased agricultural needs for food production (such as along the Mediterranean and North Sea coasts), MAR is expected to be increasingly relied on in Europe.},

   abstract = {Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a cross-cutting technology applicable to both drinking water and wastewater treatment, and is often used in combination with additional engineered treatment systems. The term MAR describes the intentional recharge (and storage) of water into an aquifer for subsequent recovery and/or for environmental benefits. MAR can be used as a source for drinking water supply, process water for industry, for irrigation and for sustaining groundwater dependent ecosystems when appropriate pre-treatment (if necessary) prior to recharge and post-treatment (if necessary) after recovery is applied. MAR relies on naturally occurring processes in the subsurface, such as mechanical filtering, sorption and biodegradation. These natural treatment processes do not require additional chemicals and were observed to be sustainable over several decades. DEMEAU, a project funded under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development of the EU, aims to demonstrate the importance of MAR, focusing on water quality impact and safety assurance. At present, the European legislation does not specify requirements for MAR and defines only a broad legal framework. To facilitate the uptake of MAR, the concept of an attenuation zone in the subsurface is highlighted as an integral part of MAR. Additionally, possible points of compliance with European water directives are shown. As part of DEMEAU, a Life Cycle Approach (LCA) was also applied to MAR sites in order to assess their economic and environmental impacts. An inventory of European MAR sites, compiling information from more than 270 sites, showcases a wide range of different MAR types that are already being applied at various operational scales and for various purposes across the European countries. It was found that some countries in Central and Northern Europe have a substantial share of MAR derived water for their water supply, while MAR is still underutilised in countries in the Mediterranean region.},

The heavily polluted Yamuna River is in hydraulic contact to the groundwater and river seepage results in a contamination  plume. A conceptual redox zonation was developed based on the occurrence or absence of terminal electron acceptors. The redox zonation shows an inverted zonation from sulphate-reducing conditions close to the river over manganese- and iron-reducing conditions to a mixed oxic/suboxic zone. This study shows that the occurrence of problematic substances such as ammonium and arsenic in the groundwater is a consequence of the high load of untreated sewage in the river in combination with losing river conditions. Sequential extraction of aquifer material was performed to obtain information on geochemical availability of arsenic associated with different mineral phases and binding forms. Geogenic and anthropogenic arsenic sources contribute to overall arsenic concentration, and arsenic is found to be attributed mainly to amorphous iron oxide and sulphidic phases in the sediment.

Human adenoviruses and noroviruses, both present in the Yamuna River in the range of 10(5) genomes/100 mL, were undetectable after 50 m infiltration and approximately 119 days of underground passage. Indigenous somatic coliphages, used as surrogates of human pathogenic viruses, underwent approximately 5 log10 removal after only 3.8 m of RBF. The initial removal after 1 m was 3.3 log10, and the removal between 1 and 2.4 m and between 2.4 and 3.8 m was 0.7 log10 each.

It is not by chance that both epidemics occurred after drinking water treatment suffered a failure, allowing contaminated drinking water to reach the consumers. In order to ameliorate the consequences of water scarcity and poor sanitary conditions, systems for obtaining drinking water are needed which are efficient, robust, and require only low-cost technology. River Bank Filtration (RBF) is a process during which surface water is induced to infiltrate into the subsurface, either due to a natural hydraulic gradient or the depression cone of an abstraction well. During infiltration and soil passage, the quality of the surface water is substantially improved thanks to a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes such as filtration, dilution with genuine groundwater, sorption and biodegradation of pollutants Apart from pathogens, organic trace compounds are widespread pollutants in rivers and lakes. The capacity of RBF to effectively or even completely remove both, pathogens and many organic contaminants has been confirmed in numerous investigations (e.g., Matthess et al. 1988). Its low costs in technology and labor makes RBF a very suitable drinking water treatment tool for developing countries. The aim of this study was to ascertain if RBF kept its power to remove pollutants and pathogens even in highly polluted waters as they are encountered in many urban agglomerations in developing countries.},

The climate sensitive factors influencing water quantity and quality also have influence on substance removal parameters such as redox conditions and travel time. Droughts are found to promote anaerobic conditions during bank filtration passage, while flood events can drastically shorten travel time and cause breakthrough of pathogens, metals, suspended solids, DOC and organic micropollutants. The study revealed that only BF systems comprising an oxic to anoxic redox sequence ensure maximum removal efficiency. The storage capacity of the banks and availability of two source waters renders BF for drinking water supply less vulnerable than surface water or groundwater abstraction alone. Overall, BF is vulnerable to climate change although anthropogenic impacts are at least as important.},

Der vorliegende Bericht dokumentiert ausgehend von der Beschreibung des Kenntnisstandes zur Verwendung von Temperaturmessungen als Tracer (Kapitel 2) die Untersuchungsstandorte und Methoden und die anschließende Datenverarbeitung der Loggerdaten und Handmessungen (Kapitel 3). Im Ergebnisteil (Kapitel 4) werden beide Standorte hinsichtlich der konservativen Tracer Chlorid, Bromid und Sulfat ausgewertet, Temperaturmessungen in den Messstellen gegen die Tiefe (Tiefenprofil) dargestellt und die Logger- und Handmessungen der Temperaturgänge im Oberflächengewässer bzw. Infiltrationsbecken und im Rohwasser der untersuchten Entnahmebrunnen mittels der semi-automatisierten Auswerteroutine erstellt und hinsichtlich der thermischen Verweilzeit verglichen. Zur Validierung erfolgen anschließend die Berechnung des thermischen Retardationsfaktors auf Basis der Isotopendaten sowie ein Vergleich mit Literaturangaben und einer theoretischen Berechnung. Aus den Messungen resultierte eine grundsätzliche Eignung der Methode, saisonale Temperaturgänge zur Verweilzeitbestimmung zu verwenden.},

This study aims at identifying major hydrogeological processes which lead to salinity ingress in the main aquifer and investigates the effect of MAR structures such as check dams. Regional hydrochemistry is discussed by a combination of stiff diagrams, Cl/Br ratios, ion exchange diagram and stable isotopes (δ18O, δD). The identified hydrogeochemical processes were high saline evolution due to intensive seawater evaporation for commercial salt production and typical ion displacement under refreshening and salinization conditions. Stable isotopes give new insights on (1) mixing processes of different end members (2) occurrence and degree of evaporation in ground- and surface water and (3) isotopical characterisation of groundwater recharge of the region. The identified processes were summarized in a conceptual model of the region. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Subsurface travel time from the area of recharge to the abstraction during Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a critical parameter to ensure sufficient attenuation for hygienic parameters and other undesired substances. This study investigates seasonal temperature fluctuations observed in recharge water and MAR wells as a proxy for cheap and reliable travel time control at a basin infiltration site in Berlin-Spandau (Germany). Based on a time series from seven years of manual measurements, temperature fluctuations observed in infiltration basins and abstraction wells were fitted to sinusoidal functions. Peak values represented as local maxima and local minima from the fitted curves were used for the approximation of travel times between infiltration basin and abstraction wells. Uncertainty was assessed by Monte Carlo simulation of fitted curves based on standard deviation (2σ) from residuals. The calculated error propagation from 2σ in infiltration basin and 2σ in wells range from 7 to 19 days. This study indicates that travel time approximation based on biased manual measurements of temperature is associated with high uncertainty. Nevertheless, the water temperature method for estimating subsurface travel times shows encouraging results and if temperature can be accurately determined, this method can be readily applied at other sites with similar characteristics.},

Das MIA-CSO-Projekt wird am Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) durchgeführt. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Kalibrierung eines Schmutzfrachtmodells eines Mischwassersystems anhand von Messdaten bezüglich der Abflussmenge und deren Wasserqualität. Die Messdaten entstammen einer Messkampagne, die aktuell von den Berliner Wasserbetrieben (BWB) durchgeführt wird. Das untersuchte Einzugsgebiet befindet sich in Wedding, einem Bezirk von Berlin. In dem ca. 480 ha großen Einzugsgebiet wohnen in etwa 70.000 Einwohner. Das Gebiet wird durch eine Mischkanalisation mit einer Länge von ca. 90 km entwässert, in der ein bewegliches Wehr in einem der beiden Hauptsammler eingebaut ist. Dieses Wehr kann bei starken Regenfällen ein zusätzliches Stauraumvolumen von ca. 3.000 m³ generieren. Durch dieses Wehr wird die Hydraulik des Kanalnetzes stark beeinflusst und erschwert die Kalibrierung des NiederschlagAbfluss-Modells zusätzlich. Die Simulationen wurden mit der Software InfoWorks™ CS durchgeführt, die von Innovyze® (USA) entwickelt wurde. Bevor die Kalibrierung durchgeführt werden konnte, wurde eine Sensitivitätsanalyse durchgeführt, um die relevanten Modelparameter zu identifizieren. Damit die Schmutzfrachten simuliert werden können, mussten die Modellparameter für jeden Schmutzstoff im Trocken- und Regenwetterfall angepasst werden. Die zu simulierenden Schmutzstoffe waren: absetzbare Feststoffe (AFS), chemischer Sauerstoffbedarf (CSB), Phosphor (P) und Ammonium (NH4). Zuerst wurden die Parameter für die Abflussmenge und dessen Wasserqualität im Trockenwetterabfluss angepasst. Für den Transport der Feststoffe wurde das Ackers-White-Modell verwendet und kalibriert. Dies war besonders wichtig, da Ablagerungen von Feststoffen im flachen Berliner Kanalnetz einen großen Einfluss auf die Schmutzfrachtsimulation haben. Zur Simulation des Regenabflusses wurde das einfache Fixed Percentage Runoff-Modell für die Abflussbildung sowie das Desbordes-Modell für die Abflusskonzentration verwendet. Die aus der Kalibrierung von mehreren Regenereignissen gewonnen Parameter wurden für die Bildung eines mittlerer Parametersatzes benutzt. Zum Schluss wurden die Parameter des Wash-Off- und des Gully Pot- Modells, welche die Wasserqualität des Regenwassers beschreiben, angepasst. Die Ergebnisse dieser Diplomarbeit zeigen, dass es möglich ist eine gute Übereinstimmung zwischen gemessenen und simulierten Konzentrationen sowie der Schmutzfracht zu erreichen. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse aus dieser Arbeit werden für das MIA-CSO-Projekt verwendet, dessen Ziel die Erstellung eines modellbasierten Planungsinstruments ist.},

   abstract = {Ozonation is known as a suitable technical process to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOC) in secondary effluent. To decide if ozonation is a suitable option as an upgrade of a specific wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), ozonation experiments in laboratory-scale can help to avoid the operation of expensive and labour intensive pilot plants. Such laboratory experiments should be conducted at similar conditions and by the same methods in order to achieve a better comparability of the results. In this study, potential impacts of sample dilution due to the addition of an ozone stock solution, water temperature, and concentration of suspended solids (TSS) on TrOC elimination and UVA254 reduction (delta UVA254) were investigated. The results show that a change in water temperature within a range of 10 to 30°C and sample dilution of less than 20% due to the addition of ozone stock solution at batch ozonation, respectively, does neither have a significant impact on achieved TrOC elimination nor or delta UVA254. Suspended solids affected the TrOC elimination and delta UVA254 at TSS concentrations of more than 30 mg/L, whereas at low TSS concentrations (< 4 mg/L), the impact of TSS was found to be neglectable.},

   abstract = {To cope with the occurrence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in the urban water cycle, different technologies have been tested to upgrade wastewater treatment plants for OMP removal. Measures are either based on adsorption onto activated carbon or ozonation. To ensure an economic and effective operation of the OMP removal, an automatic control system, which adapts the dosage to the varying water quality of the secondary effluent, is necessary. An online OMP measurement is not possible because of the high analytical afford, thus other surrogates have to be used for control purposes instead. One promising surrogate is the reduction of the ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (delta UVA254) at the ozonation stage, which correlates very well with the OMP removal. In this study, the results of the successful application of the delta UVA254 for a closed-loop control at an ozonation pilot plant for OMP removal are presented with a focus on implementation issues like coping with delay time and the choice of measurement points. OMP removal was assessed for three different delta UVA254 setpoints, of which two of them also were performed as an advanced ozone process. It could be shown that changes of the ozone demand, e.g. by a varying concentration of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrite, can be detected and countered by an adaption of the applied ozone dose.},

   abstract = {In den letzten Jahren wurde eine Vielzahl von Machbarkeitsstudien für die Aufrüstung von Kläranlagen mit einer weitergehenden Reinigungsstufe zur Reduzierung der Einleitung von organischen Spurenstoffen in Oberflächengewässer durchgeführt. Die eingesetzten technischen Maßnahmen basieren meistens auf der adsorptiven Wirkung von granulierter (GAK) bzw. pulverförmiger Aktivkohle (PAK) oder der Oxidation mittels Ozon. Während Spurenstoffe bei der Adsorption an die Aktivkohle physisch aus dem Wasser entfernt werden, so werden diese bei der Reaktion mit Ozon in andere Moleküle transformiert. Daher ist eine Spurenstoffelimination in diesem Zusammenhang als Primärelimination aufzufassen. Für einen ökonomischen und effizienten Betrieb dieser technischen Maßnahmen sind geeignete Steuer- und Regelungskonzepte erforderlich. Da eine Onlinemessung der Zielsubstanz(en) aufgrund des analytischen Aufwands nicht möglich ist, werden andere Indikatoren für die Dosisanpassung an eine variierende Wasserqualität benötigt. Ein häufig verwendeter Indikator zur Abschätzung der Spurenstoffelimination ist die auf den gelösten organischen Kohlenstoff (DOC) bezogene Ozonzehrung (mg O3 / mg DOC), die beispielsweise für eine frachtproportionale Steuerung verwendet werden kann. Diese Steuerung erlaubt jedoch keine direkte Prozesskontrolle und zur Berücksichtigung des stark ozonzehrenden Nitrits (3,4 mg O3 / mg-N) kann ein zusätzlicher Messaufwand nötig sein. Eine Alternative dazu bildet die relative Abnahme des spektralen Absorptionskoeffizienten SAK254 (delta SAK254), für welche in mehreren Studien wie z.B. [1-5] eine Korrelation mit der Spurenstoffeliminierung verschiedener Substanzen beschrieben wurde. Das erzielte delta SAK254 wird dabei von der effektiven Ozonzehrung im Wasser beeinflusst, so dass eine veränderte Wasserqualität entsprechend detektiert und durch eine Anpassung der Ozondosis ausgeglichen werden kann. Die Verwendung einer Regelung mit dem Ziel eine konstante SAK254 – Reduzierung und damit auch eine entsprechend konstante Spurenstoffelimination zu gewährleisten, bietet daher auch den Vorteil einer direkten Prozesskontrolle. Auf eine zusätzliche Onlinemessung des Nitrits kann ebenfalls verzichtet werden. Die Verwendung des delta SAK254 könnte auch für eine Pulveraktivkohledosierung interessant sein, da in den Arbeiten von [6; 7] ebenfalls ein Zusammenhang zwischen dem delta SAK254 und der Spurenstoffelimination gezeigt werden konnte.},

In the present study, a closed-loop process control based on two online UVA254 measurements was successfully implemented and tested under realistic conditions with ozone doses from 0.2 to 1.05 mg-O3/mg-DOC at a pilot scale ozonation system with subsequent coagulation filtration at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (DOC ~ 13 mg/L, UVA254 ~27m-1, and nitrite peaks of up to 1.6 mg-N/L). It could be shown that measuring the UVA254 at the ozonation effluent was superior to the measurement of UVA254 at the filter effluent in terms of response time due to changes in water quality, whereas online measurement at the filter effluent showed a better agreement with laboratory data and a reduced maintenance interval due to less particles. Additional online nitrite measurement is not necessary as the ozone consumption by nitrite directly impacts DUVA254.},

   abstract = {The overall aim of the CWPharma project is to reduce the load of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) going into the aquatic environment and especially the Baltic Sea. Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are relevant point sources of APIs, as they treat the wastewater from public households, hospitals and industry of the connected catchment area. However, conventional "state-of-the-art" WWTPs can only remove some APIs, which are either easily biodegradable and/or absorbable to activated sludge, whereas other APIs can pass the WWTP with minor to no reduction. Therefore, reduction of a broad range of APIs can only be achieved by using targeted advanced treatment techniques such as ozonation or powdered and granular activated carbon, respectively, which have already been applied on full-scale for API removal in wastewater treatment in Germany and Switzerland and proven their practical and economical suitability. At the usual applied ozone doses, ozonation of secondary effluent does not mineralize (convert an organic substance into inorganic matter) but transforms organic compounds into smaller and (usually) more biodegradable compounds. Secondary effluent is a complex water matrix consisting of hundreds of different organic substances, and it is not feasible to determine all possible transformation products and oxidation by-products, which might be created by the ozonation process. Thus, utilities and water authorities sometimes struggle with the uncertainties of the ozonation process as they perceive difficulties to judge whether oxidation of the organic matrix is beneficial or if it is creating more problems. As chemical analysis of the water only provides quantitative data for known APIs and transformation products for which chemical standards are available, effect-based ecotoxicological test systems can be used to assess the integrated actual toxicity of the whole water matrix. Based on previous research compiled by Völker et al. (2019), ozonation has a positive impact on several toxicological endpoints. But there are also indications that ozonation can create negative effects for a few toxicological endpoints that can be reduced by a suitable post-treatment. However, only little knowledge is available regarding suitable post-treatments and which ecotoxicological test systems are appropriate to evaluate their impact. In addition, post-treatment options might also have beneficial impacts on water quality parameters, APIs and transformation products. Thus, this report will evaluate different aspects regarding the impact of ozonation and its posttreatment options on (i) water quality parameters, (ii) APIs and transformation products (TPs) and (iii) ecotoxicological effects. The evaluation was conducted at three WWTPs in Linköping (SE), Kalundborg (DK) and Berlin (DE) and different post-treatment options such as moving bed bioreactors (MBBR), deep-bed filters, and a constructed wetland.},

   title = {Literature review on theoretical pump and motor efficiency of submersible pump systems},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2011},
   abstract = {There is a significant potential for optimizing pump systems currently in use in groundwater wells. This potential lies in:  (i) the improvement in pump technology, which can yield up to ~5% more efficiency, (ii) the improvement in motor technology, which can yield up to ~3% more efficiency, with further improvements if innovations from aboveground motors are adapted, (iii)  the improvement in performance adaptability, which can be very efficient in some cases (~10-50%), but also counterproductive if not adapted to current situation (0% or even efficiency loss), and sometimes not very flexible (impeller trimming); (iv) the improvement of the system maintenance and management which may yield up to ~20% more efficiency, and which, in general, has a shorter payback time than performance adaptability options.The improvement of equipments may induce only moderate additional costs if it is done at the time of scheduled new investments, after amortization of the equipment formerly in use. Unfortunately, these expected savings are influenced by uncertainties, which can be of the same order of magnitude as the savings themselves. For instance, the determination of the optimal operation point of a pump bears uncertainties between 1% and 4% and grows with pump rotation speed (Gülich 2010). Other considerable saving potentials lie within cleaning, maintenance and smart wellfield operation with short to moderate payback times (Table 6). These potentials are however very site-specific, and difficult to estimate on a general basis. Best practices for a “smart” pumping shall include choosing equipment that fits the actual requirements of the system, operating the pumps nearest of their Best Efficiency Point, and operating the motors in an energy-efficient load range. The most obvious energy savings are those associated with improvements in the efficiency of the motor and of the pump (Shiels 1998). Such gains are often worth the added capital expenditure – although often having moderate to long payback times. However, as underlined by (Kaya, Yagmur et al. 2008), that pumps have high efficiency alone is not enough for a pump system to work in maximum efficiency. An improvement of pump technology will yield, even optimistically seen, an efficiency improvement of up to 10%, which is the potential “theoretical limit” (EC 2003). For further improvements, it is necessary to consider solutions that go beyond the pump system, since maximizing efficiency depends not only on a good pump design, but also on a good system design. Even the most efficient pump in a system that has been wrongly designed is going to be inefficient. Moreover, an efficient pump in an inefficient well is pointless. Hence, a global approach of the groundwater abstraction system is required. The optimization potentials highly depend on the site characteristics themselves, on the local demand (what distribution of the demand? what load profile?), and on the operation and maintenance history (e.g., what is the cleaning frequency of the pipes, if any?). Finally, one should not forget the primary objective of water abstraction, which is satisfying a given water demand, thus, the safety of drinking water production prevails over energy efficiency. },

   abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfill bioreactors is subjected to mechanical, biological, and hydrological processes. To understand these processes, four large-scale bioreactor pilots were specifically designed to simulate the behavior of waste in the core of a landfill. Here, the results of two long-term tests that were performed in two compression cells are presented. Mechanical, biochemical, and hydrological parameters were analyzed throughout the experiments. The promising results of this research improve the understanding of biodegradation and its correlation with the hydromechanical behavior of municipal solid waste. In particular, the sensitivity of the biodegradation to leachate injection and the correlation between the biogas flow and vertical settlement were confirmed for wastes with high initial moisture content. The results showed that it is important to consider the potential of different monitoring techniques and the representative volume for the experimental approach. Furthermore, the operational results led to interesting conclusions, especially regarding the addition of moisture to waste, which is a key element for bioreactor landfill operation.},

In the context of climate change and increasing pressure on water resources, wastewater reuse and its sustainable storage could be indeed a solution to address water stress challenges. The purpose of this document is to provide sound answers to the question whether these “hybrid” solutions – involving a disinfection step, a filtration step and finally aquifer recharge (see Fig. 1) – have a real market potential or not.

While the extents of the impacts are not known yet, it is the right period to prepare the utilities to adapt to the global changes in an urbanising world. Adaptation to climate change, though not always perceived as such, is often already reality in the urban water sector. Several adaptation strategies have been tested to address the key questions: Adapt to what? What to adapt? How to adapt? In this context, within the framework of the EU-project PREPARED, a tentative classification and catalogue of implemented initiatives in the water sector has been compiled. This catalogue is organised into four major categories of initiatives: (1) risk assessment and management, (2) supply-side measures, (3) demand-side measures and (4) global planning tools. The document aims at providing examples on how utilities could go ahead into preparing their water supply and sanitation systems to climate change. Initiatives include various measures ranging from the promotion of active learning to the prevention of sewer flooding and water conservation measures. Within PREPARED, this catalogue is supporting the development of solutions. Being a living document, it is updated regularly along the project when new solutions and initiatives are known. In addition, this work and the subsequent database of adaptation initiatives are accessible to a broader audience thanks to the web-based ‘WaterWiki’ of the International Water Association (IWA).},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   number = {D 1.1},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {Wastewater reuse is increasingly considered as possible alternative water source for diverse non-potable uses. Among the major questions, defining which water quality for which reuse is required is crucial. If the demand for reclaimed water is seasonal, the question of reclaimed water storage is also essential. Aquifer recharge for further nonpotable reuse can be a solution to address many final reuse applications, including indirect agricultural or landscape irrigation, saltwater intrusion barriers, subsidence mitigation/aquifer replenishment or other non-potable reuses. Most of the aquifer recharge applications of wastewater reuse so far rely on high-pressure membrane systems or even double-membrane combined with advanced oxidation processes. However, when non-potable reuse is targeted, or the replenishment of a threatened aquifer is planned, recharge with high-quality non-potable water could be envisaged as acknowledged by the legislation of several countries. In this report, the performance of hybrid disinfection/filtration and recharge schemes is assessed in comparison to a high-pressure membrane system working under similar conditions. Among the portfolio of available disinfection and filtration technologies, five treatment trains were chosen – combinations of ozone or UV treatment with sand filters or UF membrane and final infiltration or injection – and compared to a double-membrane system (UF+NF). A synthetic secondary effluent (SE) was considered for this conceptual study on the basis of a worldwide survey of typical SE water qualities. The major legislations from the WHO, the USEPA and Australian guidelines were considered to define the water quality to be reached by these hybrid treatment schemes. The low targeted value in suspended solids (10 mg/L) and microbiological contaminants (1 fecal coliform / 100 mL) requires extensive disinfection and filtration processes. The proposed schemes were selected on the base of a large review of typical pollutant removal efficiencies found in the literature. To perform a comparative Life-Cycle Assessment of the different treatment trains, similar assumptions were made in all cases for a hypothetical case study of a 50,000-PE reuse plant downstream of a secondary sewage treatment plant. All five proposed hybrid treatment trains are capable of supplying very high non-potable water quality, and the combination of disinfection, filtration and aquifer passage proved to be an efficient combination for removing suspended solids, residual BOD and microbiological contaminants. The environmental performance of the treatment trains was compared in terms of carbon footprint, but also energy demand, human toxicity, acidification impact and land footprint. Both the energy demand and carbon footprint of hybrid schemes was found to be considerably lower than for a double-membrane system, besides offering an additional storage solution in the aquifer. Thus, there is a significant margin for lowering the environmental impact, energy demand and operational costs if non-potable water quality is sufficient for the reuse goal. However, the legal context and social acceptability may represent barriers for this intended recharge of nonpotable water to the aquifer. This conceptual study has shown the potential of hybrid solutions to provide high-quality non potable water for aquifer recharge and further reuse. A large portfolio of solutions was proposed to reach the intended non-potable uses. To assist the selection of adequate treatment trains, the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions can be summarized in a decision tree taking into account the reuse goal, aquifer type and space availability, and selecting the least energy-intensive solution for a given legal and sociocultural context.},

In this study, a well field was analysed using a coupled model that takes into account aquifer, wells, pumps and raw water pipes. This coupled approach enabled to identify and quantify the key energy demand drivers. The geometrical elevation was the most important driver, while pipe network losses were in the same order of magnitude as aquifer- and well losses. Using the modelling tool, the most energyefficient well field operation scheme could be derived and energy savings of up to 17% may be achieved by optimising well field operation only whereas further 5% may be saved by investing in new pump equipment. These findings show the potentials for significant energy savings in the field of drinking water abstraction.},

During the is operated for advanced wastewater project, different scale monolithic ceramic membrane treatment at WWTP pre-treatments, namely coagulation and the combination of coagulation and ozonation are applied. Multi-filtration trials in dead-end mode and constant flux operation are performed for over 6 months, with varying operational parameters like flux, time of filtration, dosages of coagulant and ozone. Operational behaviour is evaluated through the evolution of trans-membrane pressure via time. Also total and irreversible fouling rates are calculated showing benefits within the combined pre-treatment, regarding membrane fouling and stable operation at high recoveries (98 %). The application of 15 mgO3 ∙ L-1, respectively a specific ozone dosage from 1.0 to 1.4 mgO3 ∙ (mgDOC)-1 leads to a total fouling rate reduction of 75 %. LC-OCD analysis is furthermore used for a more detailed view on changes in DOC, especially biopolymers. Sampling of the pilot plants influent and effluent water is additionally used for the evaluation of treatment efficiency, e.g. disinfection and in particular phosphorous, where emissions are reduced to 20 ± 5 µg P ∙ L-1 in accordance with the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC).},

   abstract = {In recent decades, emerging contaminants (ECs) have surfaced as one of the key environmental problems threatening ecosystems and public health. Most emerging contaminants are present in low concentrations, and therefore often remain undetected and are also referred to as ‘micropollutants’. Despite this, many ECs raise considerable concerns regarding their impacts on human and environmental health. DEMEAU (Demonstration of promising technologies to address emerging contaminants in water and wastewater), a European Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7, 2013-2015) project, aimed to tackle ECs in drinking and wastewater by advancing the uptake of knowledge, prototypes, practices and removal technologies. The project followed a solutions-oriented approach using applied research and demonstration sites, and explored four promising technologies for EC removal and/or degradation: Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), Hybrid Ceramic Membrane Filtration (HCMF), Automatic Neural Net Control Systems (ANCS) and Advanced Oxidation Techniques (AOT). Furthermore, Bioassays (BA) were investigated as an effect-based monitoring tool. This article shares new findings for each approach and their potential for widespread integration in the drinking- and wastewater sector. Research results from DEMEAU demonstration sites show that opportunities for synergies among these developments offer the most promising and effective methods for tackling ECs in the water sector.},

   year = {2008},
   abstract = {Zielstellung des im Rahmen des EVA Projekts durchgeführten Arbeitspaketes 3 war die Entwicklung eines Optimierungsmodells des Berliner Abwassersystems, bestehend aus Kanalnetzen, Abwasserdruckleitungsnetz und Kläranlagen, sowie die Implementierung des Modells im algebraischen Modellierungssystem GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). Auf dieser Basis sollten mittels mathematischer Optimierung Strategien zur Steuerung der Abwasserströme innerhalb des Abwasserdruckleitungsnetzes während Niederschlags ermittelt werden mit dem Ziel, eine flexible, variable Beschickung der Kläranlagen zu ermöglichen. Stellgrößen für die Optimierung sind die Volumenströme oder Druckdifferenzen in den Pumpwerken und an den Schiebern im Abwasserdruckleitungsnetz. Dieser Abschlussbericht beschreibt detailliert die am Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum Berlin und am Institut für Angewandte Mathematik der Leibniz Universität Hannover durchgeführten Arbeiten. Er lässt sich gliedern in folgende Abschnitte: (i) Gesamtüberblick des Berliner Abwassersystems, Aufgabenstellung und Beschreibung der abwassertechnischen Anlagen, Daten für das Optimierungsmodell. (ii) Mathematische Modellierung des Gesamtsystems und der Komponenten, ggf. alternative Modellierungsmöglichkeiten, Beurteilung der Modelleigenschaften. (iii) Mathematische Ansätze und Lösungsmethoden mit Beurteilung ihrer Vorteile, Nachteile und Schwierigkeiten, Zusammenfassung. Während der Datenerhebung stellte sich heraus, dass das Abwassersystem hinsichtlich der Modellierung und Lösung in GAMS wesentlich komplexer ist, als es zunächst absehbar war. Dies betrifft insbesondere die Kanalnetze: hier verursachen Sonderbauwerke, wie Drosseln, Wehre und Heber zustandsabhängige Unstetigkeiten, die sich in GAMS nur mittels ganzzahliger Optimierungsvariablen adäquat modellieren lassen. Dadurch entsteht ein gemischt-ganzzahliges nichtlineares Optimierungsmodell (MINLP für engl. mixed-integer non-linear program) sehr hoher Dimension, das mathematisch wie rechentechnisch extrem schwierig zu lösen ist. So konnte bisher keine optimale Bewirtschaftungsstrategie ermittelt werden. Auch die Größe des Modells stellt eine Herausforderung dar: in der aktuellen Formulierung existieren in etwa 3 Millionen Optimierungsvariablen (davon gut 200.000 ganzzahlige) und etwa eine Million Beschränkungen (plus einfache Schranken). Somit ist das Modell etwa um einen Faktor hundert größer als bisher erfolgreich gelöste MINLPModelle. Es wurde versucht, das Abwassermodell mit dem MINLP-Löser Bonmin in Kombination mit dem NLP-Löser Ipopt in GAMS zu lösen (NLP für engl. non-linear program), erwartungsgemäß allerdings bisher erfolglos. Als Fazit bleibt festzuhalten, dass das im Rahmen dieser Studie erstellte Abwassermodell mit Standard-Optimierungstools derzeit nicht lösbar ist. Die angestrebten Untersuchungen erfordern zunächst weitere Forschungsarbeit, um das Modell einer numerischen Behandlung zugänglich zu machen. Außerdem wird eine weitergehende Vereinfachung der Beschreibung der Kanalnetzbausteine im Modell diskutiert.},

Die Vervierfachung des durchschnittlichen Monatsniederschlages führte neben einer Erhöhung des Wasserpegels umliegender Gewässer zu einer Sättigung des Bodens mit Wasser. Es bestand die Annahme, dass durch die beschleunigte Versickerung oberflächennahen Wassers ein unerwünscht starker mikrobieller Eintrag in das Rohwasser von einzelnen Brunnen der BWB stattfand. Entscheidend bei der Betrachtung des vertikalen Transportes von pathogenen Keimen im Sickerwasser im direkten Brunnenumfeld war die Frage der minimalen Fließzeit bis zum Erreichen der Filteroberkante (FOK) des Brunnens. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Untersuchung von unerwünschten Wasserzutritten entlang der Ausbaumaterialien eines Vertikalfilterbrunnens mit Tonsperre auf dem Gelände des WW Jungfernheide der BWB. Anhand von Feldversuchen, insbesondere durch den Markierungsversuch mit dem löslichen fluoreszierenden Farbtracer Uranin, sollte der ausgewählte Testbrunnen auf mögliche Kurzschlüsse an Abdichtungsvorrichtungen überprüft werden. Die Quantifizierung der Fließzeit und der Vergleich von Brunnen wurde nicht angestrebt. Es wurde lediglich bewertet, ob die Fließzeit eher im Bereich weniger Tage (Schutzfunktion fehlt) oder sich im Bereich mehrerer Wochen (Schutzfunktion vorhanden) befand. In Vorbereitung auf den Markierungsversuch mit dem Fluoreszenzfarbstoff Uranin wurden zur Bestimmung der potentiellen Versickerungsleistung innerhalb der Brunnenstube und im direkten Brunnenumfeld gezielte Vorversuche vorgenommen. Dabei wurden zum einen innerhalb der Brunnenstube potentielle Undichtigkeiten an den Brunnenkomponenten überprüft, zum anderen mit Hilfe eines provisorisch errichteten Ringinfiltrometers außerhalb des Brunnenbauwerks das Infiltrationsverhalten der Grundwasserüberdeckung erfasst. Unter Berücksichtigung einer berechneten minimal kritischen Infiltrationszeit wurde durch die Simulation eines kontinuierlichen Starkregenereignisses innerhalb von 10 Tagen der Markierungsversuch durchgeführt. Aus den gewonnenen Messergebnissen des Markierungsversuches konnte in erster Linie geschlussfolgert werden, dass es im Bereich entlang des Ausbaumaterials des Testbrunnens keine Umläufigkeiten an der Ringraumverfüllung gab und folglich eine intakte Schutzfunktion der Abdichtungsvorrichtung gegenüber schnell infiltrierendem Wasser vorhanden ist. Auch innerhalb der Brunnenstube konnte infolge der Vorversuche eine Dichtigkeit aller Komponenten nachgewiesen werden. Aufgrund einer unabsehbaren technisch bedingten Messunterbrechung während des Markierungsversuches wurde vereinbart einen zweiten Markierungsversuch zur Überprüfung der Richtigkeit durchzuführen. Da es sich bei den absolvierten Versuchen noch um unerprobte Verfahren zum phänomenologischen Nachweis von Kurzschlüssen an Vertikalfilterbrunnen der BWB handelt, ist bei einer entsprechenden Verbesserung der Methodik sowie in Betracht der schnellen und kostengünstigen Durchführung eine weitere Anwendung an Brunnen der BWB empfehlenswert.},

The development of emerging subsurfaces activities like Carbone Capture and Storage, and Hydraulic Fracturation might offer new options to tackle all three of the mentioned challenges. But, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and unconventional gas exploration (“hydro-fracking”) have in common that they impact parts of the subsurface and may thus potentially have an effect on fresh water aquifers. The combination of all the most recent studies about GCS and Hydro-fracking, allows the identification of a broad panel of key parameters that can assess and indicate a groundwater contamination resulting from emerging subsurface activities. Strong emphasis needs to be put on the fact that numerous new monitoring, verification and accounting tools are being developed worldwide threw researches programs.

   title = {Treatment of urine with zero-valent iron to minimize the aquatic pollution with compounds emitted by hospitals},
   institution = {Technische Universität Berlin},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {Advances in the analysis of organic trace compounds revealed that many of the in high amounts prescribed pharmaceutical active components as well as diagnostic agents are not removed by conventional waste water treatment techniques and that some of them can accumulate in the aquatic environment. Because most of the compounds applied in medicine are excreted via urine the emission into the aquatic environment could be reduced if the urine is separated at the source and treated by a specific process. In the project PharmaTreat it was studied if the reductive treatment with zero-valent iron is a suitable, simple and low cost process for the treatment of urine. The results show that the selected antibiotics (Ciprofloxacine, Piperacillin, Cefuroxime), cytostatic drugs (Ifosfamide and Methotrexate) and iodinated X-ray contrast media (Iopromide and Diatrizoate) are transformed by the treatment with zero-valent iron. The reaction rate constant depends highly on the pH. Under acidic conditions the mechanism of the transformation is most probably the reaction with adsorbed atomic hydrogen which is produced on the iron surface. The increase of the pH-value from 3 to 7, which might happen if the solution is discharged into the waste water system, leads to the precipitation of the dissolved iron resulting in a strong removal of the transformation products out of the solution by co-precipitation. The toxicity of the remaining transformation products was determined using the growth inhibition test (DIN 38412-37). It could be demonstrated that the biological impact of the pharmaceuticals is reduced by the transformation with zero-valent iron. By using the Zahn-Wellens-Test (DIN EN ISO 9888) it could be shown that the transformation products are better biodegradable in contrast to the original compounds, except for the iodinated Xraycontrast media. The treatment of one cubic meter urine costs 9.88 Euro. The cost estimation is based on conditions with the lowest material consumption and not on the reaction time. According to the calculated price for on cubic meter the treatment of about 6,525 m3 urine (the amount of urine produced in all hospitals of Berlin) costs ca. 64,500 Euro/a. By accelerating the reaction the treatment time can be shorten but the specific material consumption is higher whereas the energy costs are lower. In dependence of the actual prices for iron, acid and electricity the costs can be optimized for the treatment.},

   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (iii), providing a review of the potential of constructed wetlands to protect surface waters from diffuse agricultural pollution. Population growth and industrialization have lead to the demise of large majorities of natural wetland systems. Recent research continues to suggest the importance of these often saturated areas in the natural remediation of pollutants in water, as well as being aesthetically pleasing and acting as potential habitat for declining species. The drastic losses in wetland areas, combined with the realization of their importance, have stimulated recent attempts at wetland restoration and even construction of wetlands where they would not have naturally occurred. In terms of substance remediation, constructed wetlands were traditionally used for the treatment of point sources, such as urban or industrial waste water. Recently they have also become increasingly popular for the treatment of diffuse pollution from agriculture and urban storm runoff. Constructed wetlands have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of nutrients, organic matter and heavy metals. Few studies also show their potential against trace organics, such as pesticides and pharmaceutical residues and against pathogens. Retention efficiencies vary significantly among case studies. In agricultural settings the following design criteria should be considered: (i) Water residence time in wetlands is critical. Some studies concerning nutrient removal suggest that a constructed wetland should be about 5 % of the watershed area and assure water residence time of 7 days. (ii) Vegetation is important to slow down flow and increase sedimentation. Regular cutting and removal of plants is controversially discussed, since it may reduce their beneficial effect on wetland hydrology. (iii) Constant redox conditions are important to avoid release of sedimented or adsorbed pollutants. (iv) A combination of constructed wetlands with buffer strips showed very positive results.},

   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (ii) and aims at identifying numerical modelling tools that can assess the origin of contaminants as well as the impact of different mitigation measures regarding water quality aspects on a catchment scale. In order to test the identified modelling tool in the further course of the Aquisafe project a case study was found in Brittany (France) in agreement with Veolia Eau: the small watershed of the river Ic. Due to intensive agricultural land use the nitrate concentration exceeds the threshold for surface water used for drinking water purpose (which is the main concern of Veolia Eau). Additionally, trace contaminants (pesticides) were detected in the surface water ever since measurements have been carried out. Therefore modelling shall mainly support the water supplier in actions aiming at reducing the nitrate concentration in the surface water. An additional task could later on be the application of the model in order to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures against trace contamination. In order to choose the most appropriate model a model comparison was carried out using a three step approach. The first step was a screening of different information sources and resulted in the identification of 44 existing models. The second step was a pre-selection according to essential criteria in order to identify models that fulfil the basic requirements for a) the Ic nitrate issue and b) the Aquisafe trace contaminant issue. In a third step a multicriteria analysis was carried out using 6 additional criteria followed by a final recommendation. The essential criteria used for the pre-selection of the models were a) the inclusion of major hydrological processes, b) the inclusion of the nitrogen cycle (for the Ic nitrate issue) or the inclusion of trace contaminants (for the Aquisafe trace contaminant issue) c) the size of catchments that can be modelled, d) the temporal and spatial resolution and e) the possibility to include management options and/or mitigation measures. For the Ic nitrate issue this resulted in the selection of the models: HBV-NP, HSPF, SWIM, SWAT, WASMOD and Mike She. For the Aquisafe trace contaminant issue only four models remained after the pre-selection process: DRIPS, HSPF, SWAT and Mike She. Additional criteria were then applied and resulted in the recommendation to use the model SWAT for further investigations in both cases due to sufficient accuracy and included processes (full hydrological model with water quality simulation (nutrients and trace contaminants) as well as a wide range of successful applications (amongst others). This report presents a wide range of models with their capabilities and limits. It contains criteria which were identified with the stakeholders in order to choose the most appropriate model. The approach presented in this report shall support the decision process of selecting a model for a certain problem regarding water quality and includes only a recommendation. The final decision on which model shall be applied, will be taken in agreement with the stakeholders Veolia Eau and Goel’Eaux.},

   abstract = {Major reservoirs are a key element for public water supply in many countries. In Europe over 800 major reservoirs serve primarily this purpose. Eutrophication affects significant numbers of lakes and reservoirs, and is the well-known issue currently impacting drinking water supply reservoirs. In most cases, phosphorus is the principal cause of eutrophication, and therefore has been studied intensively. The presence of micro pollutants (e.g. pesticides, pharmaceutically active compounds - PhaCs) is not systematically monitored but some substances are very mobile and tend to resist degradation. Such contaminants have been detected in numerous surface water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers). As agriculture is intensifying and land use is changing in many areas, the impact of diffuse pollution on water quality is expected to be more pervasive in the future. The project Aquisafe proposes to investigate the topic in a multi-step approach which will include: i) an analysis of the nature, occurrence and risk of surface water contamination, ii) a modelling approach to quantify the contaminants origin, load and repartition to assess the effects of adapted controlled measures, and iii) the development, adaptation or optimisation of the design and operation of mitigation zones (riparian corridors and small scale wetlands) to reduce downstream loads of pollutants. Thus, Aquisafe is a first step to establish the state-of-the-knowledge on current existing solutions, identify emerging issues and assess the feasibility of using models for the evaluation of mitigation zones for contaminants removal. Within the Aquisafe project it will expected: i) a recommendation on potential key substances to be targeted, also for further investigations, ii) an identification of drinking water source vulnerability to emerging contaminants using a coupled modelling approaches, and iii) an analysis of existing mitigation methods and scientific background for the construction of riparian corridors and/or constructed wetlands in order to mitigate trace contaminants entering the surface water.},

   abstract = {Within the 3.5 year ENREM project (Enhanced Nutrient REmoval in Membranebioreactors) in Berlin-Margaretenhöhe a novel and patented process was investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of a semi-decentralised solution reaching high effluent requirements set by the water authority of Berlin. This novel process could be a solution for suburban areas of Berlin which are not connected to central sewer system. The biological process combines enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) with post denitrification in MBR technology without dosing of any carbon sources. The process configuration of this demonstration plant enables advanced wastewater nutrients removal (C, P and N) and could be a promising option for wastewater treatment wherever high effluent qualities are required. A second prototype MBR system was operated in parallel, applying a different biological process, e.g. without biological phosphorus removal, enabling a comparison of these different technological approaches. The demonstration plant showed high elimination rates for COD (>95%), phosphorus (>99%) and nitrogen (up to 98%) when operated within the appropriate range of design conditions. The operational experience within the first years showed that there is a possibility for process stabilisation by changing the ratio of the process steps. For this reason the volume of the anoxic zone was enlarged by reducing the aerobic volume in Feb 2008. The positive effects could be seen on the basis of the effluent concentrations after a short period of adaptation. The membrane filtration performance was very reliable with a new cleaning strategy: Two membranes were operated alternating with an operational flux of 15 – 20 L/m²/h and a maintenance cleaning with low chemical concentration. Different cleaning agents were used in order to evaluate the cleaning efficiencies. An economical evaluation of the demonstration plant was performed in comparison to the existing wastewater treatment costs of app. 7 €/m3 by trucking away and the prototype MBR plant. Operated on the same site, the two MBR systems were used to calculate the actual costs, in relation to the effluent quality, and to perform a scale-up up to 5000 pe considering four different effluent quality classes. The results showed that the ENREM process applied in the demonstration plant is economically an alternative for plant sizes of 5000 pe and larger. For plant sizes smaller than 5000 pe, the prototype MBR system equipped with precipitation and a downstream adsorption filter for enhanced phosphorus removal proofed to be the more viable solution.},

The operational availability, performance and economical viability of these MBR systems depend on the fi ltration performance of the membrane modules. Current chemical cleaning strategies of MBR modules, based on regular (weekly) maintenance cleanings and/or occasional (quarterly to biannual) intensive cleanings proved not to be adapted to semi-central MBR applications (100 up to 1000 p.e.): regular maintenance cleanings require automation and lead to too much care and personnel requirement. Occasional intensive cleanings increase the operational risk of membrane fouling and low cleaning recovery. In addition, semi-central MBR applications are often designed with at least two redundant fi ltration lines. An alternative chemical cleaning strategy was therefore proposed, implemented and assessed in a containerised MBR unit serving a population of about 250 p.e.: at a given time, only one fi ltration line is in operation while the other one soaks in a low-grade chemical solution. The modules are switched alternately on a monthly basis. To identify a cleaning strategy and an agent showing a good recovery, one of the modules was cleaned with H2O2, while the other was cleaned with NaOCl. A cleaning step with citric acid is added when necessary. These cleanings were tested over 16 months with the goal to minimise maintenance effort and chemicals used.},

We determined and phylogentically analysed 16S rRNA gene and cpcBA-IGS sequences of four A. bergii, three A. ovalisporum, one A. aphanizomenoides and seven Aphanizomenon sp. strains isolated from Spain, Germany, Israel and Senegal and complemented the analyses with 2 morphometric descriptions of these strains. The phylogenetic clustering did not follow the current botanical classification. All three species clustered separately from the majority of Anabaena and Aphanizomenon strains. A. bergii and A. ovalisporum clustered close to Nodularia, whereas the position of the cluster containing the A. aphanizomenoides strain varied between the trees and the different tree constructing methods used. In addition to A. aphanizomenoides, this cluster contained the two Anabaena species A. kisseleviana and A. oumina. All three species had highly similar DNA sequences at the two fragments analysed and thus, based on evolutionary distances, might be assigned to a single species. Further, our results contradict the previously formulated suggestion that A. bergii and A. ovalisporum are 3 morphotypes of a single species. Instead, A. bergii and A. ovalisporum consistently formed separate clusters, which were less than 96.6 % similar to each other based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Our results support the idea that the taxonomy of heterocystous cyanobacteria should be revised, but also emphasize the importance of detailed morphological information when molecular data of new strains is used for taxonomy.},

However, it has been detected as far north as northern Germany. While previous studies have shown that all isolated German C. raciborskii strains are hepatotoxic, little is known about the spatial occurrence and relative frequency of this species in temperate Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and relative frequency of C. raciborskii close to its northernmost distribution limit, to characterise the habitat in which it is most likely to occur in this climatic zone and to search for any other neocyanobacterial species that might be present in German waters but has so far been overlooked. One hundred forty-two water bodies in northeast Germany were sampled from June until September 2004. All cyanobacteria species were analysed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Besides C. raciborskii, two  additional neocyanobacterial species were detected: Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides. For both taxa, these findings represent their northernmost occurrence and their first report from German waters. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was present in 27%, Anabaena bergii in 9% and  phanizomenon aphanizomenoides in 7% of the samples. The occurrence of each species was analysed in relation to maximum lake depth, Secchi depth, lake volume and lake surface area. All  three species were present in a wide range of habitats, but C. raciborskii and Anabaena bergii occurred significantly more often in shallow, turbid waters than in deep, transparent water bodies. None of the parameters investigated were significantly correlated with the occurrence of Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides. In conclusion, alien thermophilic cyanobacterial species are much more widely distributed in temperate Germany than previously known. The results are discussed with respect to the possible mechanisms that enable these organisms to expand northwards.},

   title = {Diffuse trace contaminants with relevance for drinking water production in rural and semi-rural areas},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (i), providing information on trace substances, which enter surface water predominantly via diffuse sources in rural or semi-rural environments. In particular, it provides a priority list of relevant substances to aid planning of monitoring programs at waterworks, which abstract surface water from rural watersheds, for which information on substance use is sparse. As this ranking is limited to substances for which broad data sets are available from literature, it is compared to actual screening programs in predominantly rural catchments in Brittany (France) and Indiana (USA). The literature review identified pesticides as the dominant known diffuse contaminant group in rural and semi-rural settings (section 2.1). This is confirmed for the agriculturally dominated Ic Catchment in France and Upper White River Watershed in the USA, where pesticides were found to dominate the diffuse source compounds (section 3). Seven agricultural pesticides were detected in the Ic Catchment with AMPA and atrazine being the most common compounds, detected in 54 % and 41 % of all the samples, respectively. In the White River Basin 26 of the 38 detected compounds were pesticides making them the largest group of chemicals detected. Based on literature values on pesticide detection in surface waters in Germany, France and the USA, a priority list was established in section 2.2 of this report (see Table on page vi). Only seven substances were among the 20 most relevant pesticides, both in the USA and in Europe. Accordingly, US and European substances are distinguished in the priority list. Most frequently detected substances were atrazine, metolachlor and simazine for the USA, AMPA (metabolite of glyphosate), diuron and atrazine for France and diuron, atrazine and isoproturon for Germany. The importance of atrazine in Europe is interesting, since it was already banned at the time of the monitoring, indicating the high persistency of atrazine in groundwater. In some cases in Germany, concentrations in surface waters were found to follow typical seasonal application patterns, indicating illegal use (pers. Comm.. M. Bach). Although the list of substances in the USA and in Europe differ, there is an agreement to the fact that many of the pesticides applied in agriculture find their way into surface waters. The concentrations found are often beyond 0.1 µg/L. For the EU this level already corresponds to the drinking water limit. Thus, if surface water is used for drinking water production pesticides seem to be of high relevance. In finished drinking water, frequently-used Isoproturon and Bentazon were most frequently detected in Germany and France. The importance for drinking water production is emphasized by frequent detections above 0.1 µg/L in finished drinking water in nine waterworks in the US. Regarding drinking water regulation, the thresholds in the USA are substance-specific and generally more than one magnitude higher than 0.1 µg/L. As a result threshold exceedance was mainly found for Atrazine. In terms of treatability in water works, the priority list includes the efficiency of classical treatment (flocculation, filtration, ozonation) and of powdered activated carbon (PAC), which is often added in emergency situations. Particularly problematic are triazines (such as atrazine), phenoxy-type substances (such as 2,4-D and Mecoprop) and Anilides/Anilines (such as Metolachlor and Acetochlor). The pesticides found in the screenings are in good agreement with the priority list of most problematic pesticides for the US and Europe. AMPA and atrazine, the substances detected most frequently in the Ic catchment, as well as 2,4-D and dichlorprop, which were found in high concentrations > 0.1 µg/L in one sample are all included in the Europe top 20 of the priority list. Other substances on the list may not have been found because they were not measured, because of relatively high analytical detection limits of the screening or simply because they are not used in the basin, dominated by corn and wheat cultures. In the White River Basin, atrazine, acetochlor and simazine were detected at concentrations exceeding early warning levels utilized by several states in the United States, indicating their high relevance concerning drinking water production. They are also included in the US top 20 of the priority list. The priority list is a reliable basis for potentially problematic pesticides. It can thus be used as a starting point for monitoring programs in rural catchments, where no specific information on pesticide use are available. If looking for pesticides in surface water, it is important to take times of application of regarded pesticides into consideration, as shown by strong fluctuations in atrazine concentrations in the source water of a waterworks in Indiana (Figure 12 of this report). The screening results indicate that also other contaminants than pesticides may play a role in rural catchments. In the screening in the semi-rural catchments in Indiana, twelve of the detected 38 substances were not pesticides, but belonged to other groups, such as domestic use products, manufacturing additives or gasoline hydrocarbons. Of these twelve substances, seven were only found in one of the two catchments, showing a strong catchment-specific relationship. The findings indicate that other substances than pesticides may be of local importance, though in the case study all 12 substances were at least 50-fold below human health benchmarks (if defined). We conclude that the pesticide priority list given below is a good starting point for diffuse pollution screening even though it may possibly not be sufficient if major local influences, such as factories, large roads with stormwater discharges, CSO or specific local pesticide uses are present.},

As a result, future designs aim at higher reaction times by adapting size of end-of-drainage solutions to expected flows and by developing new mitigation systems for existing drainage ditches. Moreover, reaction rates are improved by forming favourable conditions for underground passage and by addition of organic carbon sources, such as straw or wood chips.

The main processes for resource recovery were steam stripping for nitrogen extraction and vacuum evaporation for volume reduction and obtaining highly concentrated nutrient solutions. The processes precipitation, crystallization, and adsorption, were used for nutrient recovery as follow-up techniques.

It is based on the “Technical Report on hydrogeological and static structural geological model implementation” (D 2.1) which focuses on the compilation of geological and hydrogeological background data (average values) and the development of a simplified conceptual hydrogeological model for a setting typical for the Northern German Sedimentary Basin as well as the model selection, model parameterization, definition of boundary conditions and implementation in hydrogeological flow model software packages. The hydrogeological model of the Cenozoic includes Quaternary and Tertiary aquifers down to the layer beneath the Rupelian clay. Moreover, a concept for modeling the interaction between deep, consolidated, saline aquifers with unconsolidated freshwater aquifers was developed. This report describes scenario analyses by using the numerical hydraulic model of the Detfurth Formation (Middle Bunter) and the simplified numerical groundwater model of the Cenozoic. The numerical models can be used to assess the key parameters, having an impact on the upconing of deeper saline groundwater beneath the well fields of water works (in shallow aquifer) due to imposed pressure signals.},

Water wells represent a unique habitat, since they create a link between the anaerobic ground water, containing Fe(II) and the aerobic surface. These special conditions set ideal conditions for the growth of iron bacteria (Stuetz and McLaughlan, 2004). Some of these bacteria are known to be responsible for well clogging by precipitation of iron hydroxides (Cullimore, 1999). The consistency of the ochres can range from soft and bulky to solid and compact. The type of deposit strongly depends on the dominant species of bacteria at the well screen and inside the gravel pack. Within this project (WellMa) a sampling system was created, which allowed the collection of unaffected biofilm samples from inside the wells. The samples were microscopically examined, DNA was extracted and community profiles were created.},

A sampling system for biofilm samples as well as a sampling device for water samples have been designed and tested.  More than 400 DNA samples of different well sites have been collected and analyzed. Microbiological and molecular methods have been combined to gain a better understanding of the community composition of the ochre forming biofilms inside the wells. Molecular methods included PCR, DGGE, cloning and sequencing.  During the project, the bacterial populations of an unprecedented number of wells have been analyzed and several indicator bacteria for iron-related well clogging have been identified. Alongside iron-oxidizing bacteria, iron-reducing bacteria have been found in the wells and their potential for ochre-solubilization was confirmed. Alongside the molecular experiments, microbiological trials included the isolation of pure cultures, microscopic analysis and physiological tests. The morphology of the encountered iron bacteria could be classified into four different groups, which may have an impact on the rigidity of the biofilms on a macroscopic level. We were able to cultivate several of these indicator organisms, which could play an important role in the formation of ochreous deposits in the Berlin wells. During experiments utilizing microscopic flow cells, differences in growth rate and patterns of these ochre-forming bacteria have been observed.  For several of the identified indicator bacteria, primers have been calculated. These primers will allow for the first time to quantify the amount of indicator bacteria in a water sample and to derive operational pointers.  In addition, several experiments regarding the effect of hydrogen peroxide on ochre forming biofilms have been conducted and the effect of an additional electron donor (ethanol) on the communities has been tested. For future data acquisition and documentation, a guideline for classifying the degree of pump clogging has been developed. },

Main focus of these studies was to investigate the formation of iron ochres in the filter area that greatly reduce the productivity of the wells. These ochreous deposits are the result of the activity of iron bacteria, which live in the border zone between oxic and anoxic water and precipitate insoluble iron hydroxides. In contrast to the shallow groundwater zone close to the surface, the deep groundwater presents a very different habitat. Pressure and chemical composition influence the community structure and the physiological properties of the dominant bacteria. In addition, a constant geologically induced temperature increase is to be expected in subsurface areas below 100 m.

   abstract = {Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya et Subba Raju and Aphanizomenon spp. are both freshwater cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales. C. raciborskii was thought confined to tropical and sub-tropical environments but spread to temperate climatic regions on all continents except Antarctica (Padisák, 1997). It is known to be widely distributed in Northern Germany reaching the northernmost margin of its distribution at latitudes of 53 - 54˚N (Krienitz & Hegewald, 1996; Stüken et al., 2006). Strains of this species are detected to produce the hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin, from which human injury has been clearly identified (Falconer & Humpage, 2006). Nostocales are characterized by trichomal structures such as vegetative cells, heterocysts and akinetes. The heterocysts can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) when aquatic nitrogen is depleted (Kim et al., 2005). Akinetes are non-motile, resistant cells that accumulate proteinaceous reserves in the form of cyanophycin granules (Wetzel, 2001). These akinetes can survive low temperatures, desiccation and other adverse environmental conditions. When favourable conditions return, they germinate to produce trichomes. The ability of Nostocales to form akinetes confers a distinct advantage in environmental adaptation and subsequent bloom formation (Kim et al., 2005; Wetzel, 2001). C. raciborskii akinetes are more commonly observed in subtropical and temperate populations late in the population cycle as a component of seasonal population dynamics (Kravchuk et al., 2006). Particular set of physico-chemical conditions stimulate akinetes to germinate (Moore et al., 2005). Light has been implicated as well as temperature and nutrients as triggering factors (Huber, 1985). According to Moore (2004) germination of akinetes occurs at temperatures between 15 °C and 30 °C in tropical Australian strains of C. raciborskii. Mischke (2003) found filaments of this species at temperatures of about 17 oC in temperate lakes with those in the Scharmützelsee region in Germany. We therefore, tried to find out at what temperature the akinetes germinate in temperate region hypothesizing it should be below 15 oC. Since Aphanizomenon species like A. gracile and A. flosaquae are the most abundant natural Nostocales in that habitat, we compare it to the invaded C. raciborskii. To figure out the germination temperature for both species, field observations are complemented by experiments at different temperatures.},

   abstract = {Thermal hydrolysis (TH) increases the anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge (WAS), but also refractory organic and nutrient return load to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This could lead to an increase in effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the WWTP. The aim of this study was to investigate the trade-off between increase in biogas production through TH and anaerobic digestion and increase in refractory COD in dewatered sludge liquors at different temperatures of TH in lab-scale. WAS was thermally hydrolyzed in temperature range of 130e170 C for 30 min to determine its biomethane potential (BMP). After BMP test, sludge was dewatered and sludge liquor was aerated in Zahn-Wellens test to determine its non-biodegradable soluble COD known as refractory soluble COD (sCODref). With increasing temperature in the range of 130e170 C, BMP of WAS increased by 17e27%, while sCODref increased by 3.9e8.4%. Dewaterability was also enhanced through relative increase in cake solids by 12 e30%. A conversion factor was defined through mass balance to relate sCODref to volatile solids of raw WAS. Based on the conversion factor, expected increase in effluent CODs of six WWTPs in Berlin were predicted to be in the range of 2e15 mg/L after implementation of TH at different temperatures. It was concluded that with a slight decrease in temperature, formation of sCODref could be significantly reduced, while still benefiting from a substantial increase in biogas production and dewaterability improvement.},

   abstract = {Combined sewer overflows (CSO) after heavy rainfall can cause acute depletions of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Berlin River Spree. A planning instrument for CSO impact assessment has been developed in the framework of the research project MIA-CSO at the Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin. This instrument couples the sewer model InfoWorks CS, the water quality model Hydrax/QSim and an impact assessment tool. Within this thesis it is tested for various CSO management strategies and climate change scenarios. The coupled sewer-river-model InfoWorks CS-Hydrax/QSim was validated for the years 2010 and 2011. Simulation results for the critical parameters discharge and DO concentrations in the Berlin River Spree agree well with measurements. Although not all observed DO deficits can be simulated accurately, the very good representation of processes related to the oxygen budget allows assessing relative changes in boundary conditions, e.g. from different CSO control strategies. The conducted scenario analysis indicates that the coupled sewer-river-model reacts sensitively to changes in boundary conditions (temperature, rainfall, storage volume and other CSO control strategies, etc.). Based on the simulation year 2007 - representing an extreme year with regards to CSO volume and critical conditions in the river - sewer rehabilitation measures planned to be implemented until 2020 are predicted to reduce total CSO volumes by 17% and discharged pollutant loads by 21-31%. The frequency of critical DO conditions for the most sensitive local fish species (<2 mg/L) will decrease by one third. For a further improvement of water quality after the year 2020, the reduction of impervious surfaces emerges as a very effective management strategy. A reduction of the impervious connected area by 20% results in a decrease in the frequency of critical DO conditions by another third. The studied increase in surface air and water temperature as part of the climate change scenarios leads to a significant aggravation of DO stress due to background pollution in the Berlin River Spree, while acute DO depletions after CSO are barely affected. However, changes in rain intensity have a considerable effect on CSO volumes, pollutant loads and the frequency of critical DO concentrations. The extended sensitivity analysis shows that a general reduction of discharged pollutant loads by 60% based on the sewer status 2020 can prevent critical DO conditions in the Berlin River Spree, even for the exceptionally rain intense year 2007. Further, it has been shown that the entry and biodegradation of organic carbon compounds is the most important process for acute DO depletions after CSO. However, mixing of oxygen free spill water with the Berlin River Spree provokes an additional impairment of DO conditions. In the framework of this thesis, CSO impacts under different management strategies or climate change conditions are only assessed for a part of the Berlin combined sewer system and for one exemplary year. Before applying the presented instrument for planning specific measures it is proposed to expand the model area and simulated time period.},

An additional impairment of DO conditions is caused by the inflow of oxygen free CSO spill water and suspended solids into the Berlin River Spree. In this report, CSO impacts under different management strategies or climate change conditions are assessed only for a part of the Berlin combined sewer system (although the main part) and for one exemplary year. An extension of the planning instrument to the entire combined sewer system would enable to evaluate the full impact of measures. For a robust prediction of future CSO impacts it is also recommended to test different simulation periods or conduct long-term simulations.},

   abstract = {Artificial groundwater recharge (AR) is used as semi-natural pre-treatment for drinking water production in Berlin and many other sites world-wide. Earlier research has focussed on the degradation of organic substances in these recharge systems (NASRI final reports 1 – 6), and has improved our knowledge of AR in the specific sites in Berlin. Nevertheless, a process understanding which might enable a transfer to other sites and boundary conditions is still lacking. Since biodegradation – which is assumed to be the main removal process of organic compounds – depends on the presence and activity of microorganisms, characterisation experiments with respect to biological activity will help to interpret results from soil column experiments simulating AR. In this stage of the OXIRED project, it will be of interest to link biological activity to degradation patterns in soil columns. Therefore, the following questions related to microorganisms could be necessary to answer: 1) How many are there? 2) How active are they? 3) Who is living there? A review of published literature yielded that in general, soils and sediments contain great numbers of microorganisms. Whereas in surface soils concentrations of culturable microorganisms can be found in the range of 108 per gram of dry soil, the number of culturable organisms in the subsurface are dependent on depth and are generally lower. In order to analyse them, adapted sampling methods and a sound sampling strategy are necessary for a reliable overview of microbial life. Another important aspect of microbial investigations is the detachment of organisms from biofilms for which enzymatic based methods have proven to be very useful. Different microbiological and biomolecular methods were described and assessed with respect to their suitability: 1) Cultivation: Since less than 1% of the microorganisms in natural environments can be cultured they will not be useful when one aims to get more insight into the microbial community. 2) Nucleic acid based techniques: Whereas DNA based primers can be used to detect specific species, general primers can be used to get a broad overview of the microbial life within a sample. Furthermore, active organisms can be detected by the use of RNA based primers. 3) Physiological technique: Microbial activity can be estimated indirectly based on AOC or BDOC measurements. To assess the micro-organisms present in soil columns and their activity the following methods are recommended: (i) Substrate degradation assessments by BDOC (or AOC) measurements (normally done in column studies) (ii) Direct counts (DAPI/ Acridine Orange) of direct extracted organisms and organisms present on buried slides. (iii) DGGE with universal primers (iv) qPCR (v) Direct counts with LIFE/DEAD staining and (vi) CTC redox dye o Clone libraries constructed from DGGE bands In addition to an extensive literature database of references for further details the results are summarized in a table with an overview of methods for detection, quantification and activity assessments of microbial communities in soils and sediments.},

   abstract = {Access to microbiologically and chemically safe water is limited not only in developing countries, but also in transition Countries and even in remote areas of some developed countries. For these cases, point-of-use (POU) technologies can be promising alternatives to centralized treatment concepts. Membrane-based treatment systems have gained importance for drinking water treatment in the developed countries and can be considered as the dominant technology for new applications at present. Due to the high retention of pathogens and the possibility of downscaling (modular construction) membrane technology seems to be attractive also for application as POU system in developing and transition countries. However, no scientific publications on such systems are available and application is limited. Therefore we conducted an extensive literature and state-of-the art review to evaluate relevance, current use and the research and development needs of membrane-based POU systems in developing and transition countries. POU technologies are widely being used to produce safe and high quality drinking water in rural areas of industrialized countries, where access to centralized supply is not available, or for additional treatment of tap water. However, the cost level of POU systems applied in industrialized countries is in general not acceptable in other cases. Therefore simple low cost systems were developed and applied in developing and transition countries. In a range of case studies, described in literature, these systems show themselves as an appropriate short term solution, but often fail to provide improved access to necessary amounts of safe water. Economical growth of developing and transition countries leads to increasing public concern, affordability and requires long term sustainable solutions of the drinking water problem. Membrane-based POU/POE systems are especially attractive for application in developing and transition countries while they can provide high removal of bacteria, protozoa and viruses, have modular design and can be operated with a range of different energy sources, including mechanical and hydrodynamic energy. But, for their application in developing and transition areas, the cost level is in general not acceptable. Furthermore, the source water quality is often very low and can differ regionally as well as seasonally, and the POU/POE systems should be able to treat this kind of waters. Another critical factor in transition and especially in developing countries is the maintenance and control. Not only the level of education of the local population may be insufficient, but also structural financial means for maintenance and control may be lacking.},

The first part of the study concerns the design and testing of a hydraulic model. At the beginning it was implemented on MS Excel and after with the help of Epanet, an opensource software. Data from the operator and manufacturers as well as measured data, gained during a site audit, were used to calibrate the model. Goals were to understand how the well field was working and to identify the energy demand drivers. The second part of the study concerned the choice and the implementation of scenarios with different operational conditions for the well field. Scenarios were focused on two aspects: the change of boundary conditions and the study of possible investments. A cost comparative assessment was carried out to estimate the payback times of the investigated scenarios. Results and according recommendations were communicated to the well field manager.},

   abstract = {The increasing application of plastic products during the last 60 years, entailed an undesirable plastic input to the environment. Small plastic particles (microplastic) are able to reach the water cycle by households and urban areas. Microplastics are defined as particles with smaller than 5 mm and could be subdivided into two groups. Primary microplastics are engineered materials used as product additives for cosmetics, peelings and cleaning agents. Secondary microplastics are produced from the embrittlement of common plastic products, due to physical, chemical or biological degradation processes.The project “Optimized materials and processes for the separation of microplastic from the water cycle” – OEMP founded by the German Bmbf intends the development of new restraining materials and separation processes of various microplastic particles (different in size, shape, type of plastic). Different entry pathways of the urban water cycle in city areas (effluent from wastewater treatment plants, combined sewer overflows, street drainage) are investigated for the purposes of optimized technical approaches, to ensure a sustainable water economy with high class standards in protection of the surface waters. Therefore, a proper assurance is needed, that examines the different technical and natural systems with regard to their retention qualities. An integrant is an evaluable methodology for sampling and analytics of microplastic, as well as a first benchmark of the purification processes, which are developed during the project OEMP. For the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant high performance filtration materials were developed. The first field tests are evaluated and show relevant reduction of suspended solids. The cloth filtration media and for sieve filtration show a removal efficiency of more than 70 % for the Materials down to 20 microns. Further test with pore size materials down to 6 microns will follow. The following figures explain the principle of the cloth filtration media and the sieve filtration. For the fine materials fare higher reduction rates are expected. To analyze the samples a thermal extraction method was developed as well as a sampling technique for high sampling volumes up to 2 m3 to measure the amount of microplastics in the frictions of 500, 100, 50, and 6 microns. Plastics and microplastics will be preserved in the environment for many years, therefore systematic studies in the field of urban water management are reasonable. To implement promising technics for separating microplastics from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant and mixes sewage water at existing infrastructure the municipality, the industry, the research and the citizen/consumer are requested to collaborate.

   abstract = {Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets were compiled for the littoral (29 km2) and pelagic (329 km2) of ancient, deep, clear, and hard water Lake Ohrid (Albania and North Macedonia), to assess the importance of the littoral in nutrient retention. P originates mainly from domestic point sources (73%), for N this is karst seepage (50%). Total littoral loads are estimated at 1700 kg P and 23,200 kg N km-2 (area of littoral) yr-1; net littoral retention is 31% ± 13% for P and 40% ± 16% for N, largely in the dense charophyte belt. P retention is mainly due to detritus burial, but also due to coprecipitation; N retention is due to both detritus burial and denitrification. A Monte Carlo plausibility analysis balanced the budget by increasing nonconnected domestic household inputs (from 20% to 27% of external load), and decreasing pelagic sediment P burial by 27% and littoral denitrification by 25%. Scenario projections for 2100 corresponding to SRES A2 and B1 were linked to an AQUASIM lake ecosystem model. Under B1, the changes were small compared to the present. A2, however, led to a major reduction in precipitation, an increase in evapotranspiration, a reduction in river outflow (to ~20%), a doubling in P-loading, a drop in lake level of ~1.5 m, and a decline in the extent of the charophyte belt. Areal loading of the littoral would increase accordingly, but water transparency would not decline much. Also, the littoral vegetation will witness a shift in species composition, and an increase in filamentous Cladophora cover.},

   title = {Effectiveness of Riparian Zones in Contaminant Mitigation Project acronym: AQUISAFE 1},
   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2009},
   abstract = {
The Aquisafe project aims at mitigation of diffuse pollution from agricultural sources to protect surface water resources. The first project phase (2007-2009) focused on the review of available information and preliminary tests regarding (i) most relevant contaminants, (ii) system-analytical tools to assess sources and pathways of diffuse agricultural pollution, (iii) the potential of mitigation zones, such as wetlands or riparian buffers, to reduce diffuse agricultural pollution of surface waters and (iv) experimental setups to simulate mitigation zones under controlled conditions. The present report deals with (iii) and has the purpose to provide a brief overview of the current state of knowledge related to the role of riparian zones as best management practices for water quality improvement at the watershed scale. Research indicates that landscape hydrogeological characteristics such as topography and surficial geology influence both riparian zone hydrology and biogeochemistry. Topography, depth to a confining layer and soil hydraulic conductivity all affect groundwater input to riparian zones and the water table fluctuation regime throughout the year. Research also indicates that although most biologically mediated reactions in soil are redox dependant, landscape hydrogeology, by affecting riparian hydrology, affects the redox conditions in the soil profile. In turn, microbial processes and changes in element concentrations are predictable as a function of the redox state of the soil.Variations in biogeochemical conditions directly affect the fate of multiple contaminants in riparian systems. In particular, variations in soil redox potential in riparian zones can affect the evolution of numerous contaminants and solutes within riparian zones like pesticides, phosphorus, NO3-, N2O, NH4+, SO42-, CH4, Fe2+/Fe3+ or Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). Of all the solutes/contaminants mentioned above, nitrate is one of the most important concerning water quality in many areas of the US and Western Europe. Consequently, many studies have investigated nitrate removal in riparian systems. Depending on site conditions, nitrate retention generally varies between 60 and 90 %; however, there are situations where nitrate removal is less or even where a riparian zone becomes a source of N to the stream. Although the riparian literature is clearly dominated by nitrate removal studies, many studies also focus on phosphorus, sediments, pesticides, chloride, bromide and bacteria. Although there are situations where riparian zones have been shown to be sources of P, Atrazine, bromide, E. coli or E. streptococci bacteria, riparian zones generally contribute to the reduction of most contaminants in subsurface flow and overland flow. Nevertheless, although conditions favorable to the reduction or oxidation of a given contaminant at the microbial level are often known, more research needs to be conducted to determine the variables controlling the fate of contaminants other than nitrate in soil at the riparian zone scale.Finally, although many studies have investigated the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of riparian zones in the past few decades, much research remains to be conducted in order to quantify and predict the impact of riparian zones on water quality at the watershed scale in a variety of climatic and hydrogeological settings. In particular, better strategies and/or tools to generalize riparian function at the watershed scale need to be developed. Particular areas where research is needed to achieve this goal include: 1) the development of strategies to quantify and model the cumulative impact of individual riparian zones on water quality at the watershed scale; 2) a better quantification of the importance of spatial and temporal variability in hydrologic and biogeochemical riparian functioning relative to annual nutrient transport; 3) a better understanding of the role of vegetation in terms of its impact on riparian biogeochemical processes and the response of these processes to manipulations of vegetative cover; 4) a better understanding of the impact of human activities and infrastructure on riparian zone function in both urban and rural landscapes; 5) a better understanding of the fate of emerging contaminants in riparian systems.},

   abstract = {This study investigates a post-denitrification process without the addition of an external carbon source combined with an enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Three trial plants, with two different process configurations, were operated on two different sites, and a variety of accompanying batch tests were conducted. It was shown that even without dosing of an external carbon source, denitrification rates (DNR) much above endogenous rates could be obtained in post-denitrification systems. Furthermore, the anaerobic reactor located a head of the process had a positive impact on the DNR. Given these surprising results, the project team decided to identify the carbon source used by the microorganisms in the postdenitrification process. Batch tests could demonstrate that lysis products do not play a major role as a C-source for postdenitrification. The following hypothesis was proposed to explain the observations: the glycogen, internally stored by the substrate accumulating bacteria, if anaerobic conditions are followed by aerobic conditions could act as carbon source for denitrification in post-denitrification system. First exploratory batch tests, where the glycogen evolution was monitored, corroborate this
assumption.},

   abstract = {As part of the EU-Life ENREM demonstration project the Department of Chemical Engineering, TU Berlin, was appointed to conduct the preliminary pilot trials in a representative site for verification of basic process designs and operation criteria of the full-scale MBR demonstration plant. In addition to conception and construction of the pilot plant, this investigation consists of two successive trial phases with distinct operation conditions: the first one being dedicated to the assessment of the “irregular sludge wastage strategy” (the biomass is accumulating in the reactor, which is partly emptied when the sludge concentration reaches a given value), and the second one being planned to verify normal operation conditions with daily sludge wastage. This progress report describes implementation and results of the first phase, for which a pilot plant of 140L was operated over 6 months with waste water of a decentralized area. The influent contained high concentrations of nitrogen (100-200 mg/L), phosphorus (10- 20 mg/l) and COD (1000-2000 mg/L). Also surprising were the high VFA concentrations (100-300 mg/L) which ensured a good EBPR process.  The COD and also the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) were not impacted by the irregular sludge wastage. COD effluent concentrations were around 50 mg/L and TP effluent was 0.1 to 0.3 mg/L.  The high nitrogen influent concentrations were problematic. Due to changing TS concentrations and changing nitrification rates TN effluent was 10 to 30 mg/L with a NH4-N content of 0 to 20 mg/L. Denitrification rates were measured between 1 and 3 mgN/gVS h and were depending on TS concentration, with higher rates at lower TS concentrations. Polysaccharide concentrations in the sludge water phase were higher with low TS concentrations and low oxygen concentrations. Higher PS values led to faster fouling. Results of the trials suggest that the oxygen concentration should be kept above 2mg/L to ensure both sufficient nitrification and lower fouling. Since also high TS concentrations are needed to ensure complete nutrients removal the optimum TS range is relatively small and it must be concluded that the irregular sludge wastage strategy was not beneficial in this case and the demonstration plant should be run with regular sludge removal.},

The first one was dedicated to the assessment of the “irregular sludge removal strategy” (the biomass is accumulating in the reactor, which is partly emptied when the sludge concentration reaches a given value). In the second trials phase normal operation conditions with daily sludge wastage were implemented with 28,5d SRT. The major outcome of the trials was that COD removal, enhanced biological phosphorus removal and the post-denitrification performed a similar way under both operational conditions. The denitrification rate was approximately 1 mgN/(h goTS). An influence of the anaerobic sludge loading on the post-denitrification rate was observed with higher rates (up to 4 mgN/(h goTS)) corresponding to higher organic loading. An influence of storage compounds built up in the anaerobic phase is assumed. Nitrification was better in the second phase when 4 mgN/(h goTS) were constantly reached while nitrification was unstable with an average of 2 mgN/(h goTS) in the phase of irregular sludge removal. The aerobic and anoxic reactors were enlarged during the regular sludge withdrawal phase by 23% resulting in 35d SRT. This led to a better COD removal and slightly better nitrogen removal. The enhanced SRT produced possibly a deterioration of biological P removal due to overloaded poly-P storage. A second possible reason is the massive reproduction of sludge worm Tubifex tubifex, which was observed after the plant enlargement. Different strategies to reduce the worm population were attempted. Ammonium dosing had no success. Copper dosing reduced the number of worms significantly but the population grew back after the dosing was stopped. The prolongation of SRT reduced the sludge yield from 0.23 gTS/gCOD at 28.5d to 0.18 gTS/gCOD at 35d.},

   abstract = {For small membrane bioreactor (MBR) plants, in order to save investment for infrastructure, it could be beneficial not to withdraw excess sludge on a daily basis, but to store it in the biological reactor and only withdraw it every 2 to 4 weeks. This study aimed at investigating the effect of such an excess sludge removal strategy on the performance of an MBR plant in terms of permeate quality, nutrients removal rates and fouling. An MBR pilot plant, fed with domestic waste water from a remote area, was operated with enhanced biological phosphorus removal and post-denitrification without carbon dosing. 50% of the reactor volume was withdrawn when around 13 g l-1 TS was reached in the membrane reactor. This sludge removal strategy did not lead to failure of neither the biological phosphorus removal, nor the post-denitrification. Higher specific denitrification rates (DNR) were observed during higher organic loading of the anaerobic zone. The average DNR at 20°C was 1.5 mgN(gVSS h)-1. Nitrification was influenced by the discontinuous excess sludge removal. During that period the nitrification rate varied in a wide range between 1.8 and 5 mgN(gVSS h)-1, with a trend to lower rates right after a sludge removal. Fouling was not effected by the excess sludge removal strategy. For both withdrawal strategies the fouling rate was around 5*1010(md)-1. The EPS concentration did not affect the fouling behaviour.},

   abstract = {Upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced technologies is one key strategy to reduce micropollutant emissions. Given the complex chemical composition of wastewater, toxicity removal is an integral parameter to assess the performance of WWTPs. Thus, the goal of this systematic review is to evaluate how effectively ozonation and activated carbon remove in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Out of 2464 publications, we extracted 46 relevant studies conducted at 22 pilot or full-scale WWTPs. We performed a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of in vitro (100 assays) and in vivo data (20 species), respectively. Data is more abundant on ozonation (573 data points) than on an activated carbon treatment (162 data points), and certain in vitro end points (especially estrogenicity) and in vivo models (e.g., daphnids) dominate. The literature shows that while a conventional treatment effectively reduces toxicity, residual effects in the effluents may represent a risk to the receiving ecosystem on the basis of effect-based trigger values. In general, an upgrade to ozonation or activated carbon treatment will significantly increase toxicity removal with similar performance. Nevertheless, ozonation generates toxic transformation products that can be removed by a post-treatment. By assessing the growing body of effect-based studies, we identify sensitive and underrepresented end points and species and provide guidance for future research.},

   type = {Master Thesis},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {The goal of this study is to analyze whether the integration of a Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC) process into sewage sludge disposal routes improves the holistic energy balance compared to state of the art technologies. Furthermore the decisive parameters for the improvement are identied. For this a static model is set up within the energy and material flow calculation software Umberto. Within the selected treatment scenarios without and with anaerobic digestion the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) are determined per functional unit disposal of one kg TSsludge. The model is fed with full-scale data from state of the art sludge treatment and data of a pilot HTC plant. It comprises all relevant processes including their chemicals and energy demands as well as transportation of materials. Expenditures for infrastructure are excluded. The reference input flow is based on the annual sludge amount of a waste water treatment plant for 500,000 people equivalents. The final disposal options of the sludge or hydrochar are either co-incineration within a lignite power plant or mono-incineration. Some co-products such as electricity, biomass fuel (dried sludge, hydrochar) and nitrogen fertilizer are created during sludge treatment and accounted for as substitutes for production of equivalent resources. HTC distinguishes from the conventional sludge treatment by improved mechanical dewaterability of the products. It reaches dry matter contents of ~ 65%. Trade-offs are the significant process heat demand of 88kWh/m3 sludge at high temperatures > 220 °C and a decreased mass yield of 72 % for the undigested and 75 % for the digested sludge. The dry matter loss results in process liquor with multiple load compared to raw sludge liquor (80 x org. C, 60 x Ntot, 25 x Ptot). The CED and GWP results generally show good correlation. For the CED of raw sludges the net values range from savings of -11.7 to expenditures of +1.8MJ/kg TS. The GWP ranges from -1.07 to +0.43 kg CO2-eq/kg TS. The net values for the HTC scenarios exceed the reference scenarios for undigested sludge when the dry matter content after sludge dewatering is < 27% or if it is ~ 27% and the process heat demand of the HTC can be reduced by half e.g. via insulation. However, the best scenario for undigested sludge includes HTC with a small scale digester only for the liquor. The loads are largely reduced, saving energy for the return ow treatment and producing biogas for use in a CHP plant. The heat can be fed to the HTC reactor while grid electricity is substituted. In disposal routes including sludge digestion the CED ranges from -11 to -1.1MJ/kg TS and the GWP ranges from -0.73 to +0.22 kg CO2-eq/kg TS. The scenarios with HTC exceed the reference scenarios irregardless of the TS after dewatering. The HTC liquor is returned to the digester, reducing the load and yielding extra biogas as mentioned above. Also, with sludge digestion the HTC process benefits from the larger amount of CHP heat. It is sufficient to cover the heat demand within the analyzed scenarios. The reference sludge treatment is based on representative full-scale data, but the pilot plant data of HTC showed inconsistencies. The data has to be validated in full scale. Furthermore, important aspects such as refractory COD within the hydrochar liquor, pollutants such as heavy metals, legal aspects of the hydrochar incineration, nutrient recovery and economic aspects have to be addressed in future studies.},

   abstract = {In dieser Arbeit wird die Eignung von zwei Vertikalbodenfiltern, die an einer Ozonung (O3) zur weitergehenden Spurenstoffelimination im Kläranlagenablauf nachgeschaltet werden, untersucht. Die Bodenfilter unterscheiden sich primär in den verwendeten Filtermaterialien: Sand, als konventionelles Füllmaterial (BF1), und BioChar als alternatives Substrat (BF2). Letzteres setzt sich aus Lava- und Pflanzenkohle zusammen und soll auf Grund der zusätzlichen adsorptiven Reinigungsleistung für eine weitergehende Spurenstoffelimination sorgen. Die Pilotanlage wurde während des Versuchszeitraums wöchentlich an vier Messstellen (Zu- und Ablauf der Ozonanlage, Abläufe beider Bodenfilter) beprobt und hinsichtlich Wasserqualitätsparameter und Spurenstoffe untersucht. Die ausgewählten Spurenstoffe stammen aus den Bereichen Pharmazie, Landwirtschaft und Industrie. Allgemein sorgten die Bodenfilter für eine Verbesserung der Wasserqualität, welche sich unter anderem durch eine Reduktion des CSB und des DOC äußerte. Der CSB verringerte sich von 28,8 mg/L (Ablauf Ozonung) auf 18,4 mg/L (BF1) bzw. 17,4 mg/L (BF2), der Nitratgehalt von 12,1 mg/L auf 10,1 mg/L (BF1) bzw. 8,5 mg/L (BF2). Ebenfalls sorgten beide BF für eine Verminderung des Gesamtphosphors, welcher von 0,44 mg/L auf 0,11 mg/L (BF1) bzw. 0,27 mg/L (BF2) reduziert wurde. Der gelöste Phosphoranteil und das Orhophosphat reduzierten sich ebenfalls im BF1 (Pgel um 0,06 mg/L und oPO4 um 0,03 mg/L), wohingegen diese Fraktionen im BF2 um 0,10 mg/L (Pgel)und0,13mg/L (oPO4) anstiegen. Bei den Spurenstoffen zeigte die Ozonanlage hohe Wirkungsgrade (> 95%) bei einigen Substanzen, wie zum Beispiel für Diclofenac und Carbamazepin. Im BF1 lassen sich keine zusätzliche Elimination der Spurenstoffe feststellen. Wohingegen im BF2 eine weitergehende Elimination auf Grund der adsorptiven Wirkung bei vier Substanzen (Candesartan (CAN), Benzotriazol (BTA), Metoprolol (MTP), Oxipurinol (OXP)) zu beobachten war. Während des Versuchszeitraums sind sehr hohe Eliminationsleistungen (> 95%) in der Verfahrenskombination O3 + BF2 bei den Spurenstoffe MTP und BTA zu verzeichnen. Dabei waren die Unterschiede bei BTA deutlich ausgeprägter: der Wirkungsgrad stieg von 74,5 (O3 + BF1) auf 90,5% (O3 + BF2). Der größte Unterschied innerhalb der BF bestand bei OXP. Dort erhöhten sich die Wirkungsgrade von 43,1% auf 88,7%. Gegen Ende des Versuchszeitraumes deutete sich eine Abnahme der Eliminationsleistungen von CAN und OXP an, welches auf eine Erschöpfung des Sorptionspotentials schließen lässt. Ähnliche Tendenzen zeigen sich bei Raumfiltern, welche mit Aktivkohle gefüllt sind. Daher ist davon auszugehen, dass sich die Leistungsfähigkeiten des BF2 mit steigender Betriebsdauer denen des BF1 angleichen. Insgesamt eignen sich Vertikalbodenfilter für die Aufbereitung von ozoniertem Abwasser. Im Vergleich zu konventionellen Raumfiltern weisen sie einen geringeren Wartungsaufwand auf, besitzen aber einen deutlich höheren Platzbedarf (Faktor 1700). Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit lassen darauf schließen, dass die weitergehende Spurenstoffelimination der Bodenfilter vergleichbar mit ähnlich gefüllten Raumfiltern ist.},

Besides difficulties to remove the skin layer that is necessary during the drilling process, it is also not easily possible to determine if a skin layer is present in a well and whether or not it imposes a certain degree of well loss. With this work, three types of skin layers are presented (surface cake, deep-bed filtration, layered cake in the aquifer), that have been observed at dewatering wells excavated in open-pits of the Rhenish lignite mining district in western Germany. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were analyzed for their geochemical and mineralogical composition in order to better understand the formation of the skin layer types and their fate during well operation. Geochemical analysis revealed the skin layer to be mainly composed of quartz (≈ 40 wt-%), kaolinite/illite (≈ 30 wt-%), organic material (5-15 %) and secondary gypsum precipitates (up to 12.5 wt-%). Despite the high quartz contents, the granulometry yields high fractions of clay and silt (75-85 %). However, preferential flow paths, transecting the skin layer are created by micro-cracks and erosion-pathways which will cause a higher hydraulic conductivity than could be expected from the granulometry.},

   abstract = {Wastewater treatment (WWT) is obligatory for the protection of ecosystems and human health but also produces the greenhouse gases (GHGs) nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) along the process chain. According to the IPCC (2018) anthropogenic CO2 and carbon emissions must decline by 45% worldwide from 2010 levels by 2030 to keep temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 ° degrees. Currently the sector of WWT contributes about 0.11 % to the total carbon emissions in Germany and was responsible for about 5 % of global non-CO2 GHG emissions in 2005. N2O emissions in particular play the major role here. Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) for biological WWT has gained increasing interest mainly due to higher process efficiency compared to conventional activated sludge (CAS). Studies show a reduction potential of 20 – 25 % in operation costs, 23 – 40 % in electricity use and 50 –75 % in space requirements. AGS processes are implemented as sequencing batch reactor (SBR). SBRs with a small temporal and spatial variability for biological metabolism are likely to generate process conditions promoting N2O formation. A 1% increase in direct N2O emissions could already result in a 30 % increase of the carbon footprint of a WWTP. In this thesis direct GHG emissions from AGS treating domestic wastewater are studied. It was part of the project E-VENT where an AGS Nereda® pilot-plant has been operated at Stahnsdorf WWTP, Berlin (Germany). The reactor was fully-covered and GHG emissions have been monitored online over a 3 months period. A conservative approach for off-gas flow determination has been chosen to not over-estimate GHG loads. The plant was operated with domestic wastewater extracted after the primary clarifiers. At stable operating conditions maximum removal rates of 96 % chemical oxygen demand, 90 % nitrogen and 87 % phosphorous were achieved. Determined emission factors (EF) for N2O and CH4 over the complete measurement period were 2.86 % and 0.18 % respectively. Rising process temperatures from 13 – 20 °C showed a positive correlation with EFs and higher TN loads during the day lead to higher N2O complementing literature review on N2O EFs. The CO2 EFs showed that determined values for AGS are in accordance with 2.8 % ± 1.2 % found in a comparable study by Guimarães et al. (2017). Findings conclude that N2O contributes to about 95 % to total direct carbon emissions of the Nereda® plant and is a main factor for the climate impact of AGS.},

   abstract = {The present study examines the contribution of combined sewer overflows (CSO) to loads and concentrations of trace contaminants in receiving surface water. A simple method to assess the ratio of CSO to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents was applied to the urban River Spree in Berlin, Germany. The assessment indicated that annual loads are dominated by CSO for substances with removal in WWTP above w95%. Moreover, it showed that substances with high removal in WWTP can lead to concentration peaks in the river during CSO events. The calculated results could be verified based on eight years of monitoring data from the River Spree, collected between 2000 and 2007. Substances that are well removed in WWTP such as NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) were found to occur in significantly increased concentration during CSO, while the concentration of substances that are poorly removable in WWTP such as EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) decreased in CSO-influenced samples due to dilution effects. The overall results indicate the potential importance of the CSO pathway of well-removable sewage-based trace contaminants to rivers. In particular, high concentrations during CSO events may be relevant for aquatic organisms. Given the results, it is suggested to include well-removable, sewage-based trace contaminants, a substance group often neglected in the past, in future studies on urban rivers in case of combined sewer systems. The presented methodology is suggested for a first assessment, since it is based solely on urban drainage data, which is available in most cities.},

   institution = {Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH},
   year = {2013},
   abstract = {This report summarizes relevant available knowledge on the removal of micropollutants from WWTP effluent in natural treatment systems such as constructed wetlands (polishing). Five studies were found investigating removal of various micropollutants in eight different full scale systems located in Spain, southern France, Korea and Sweden (all being different configurations of free water surface wetlands), demonstrating good removal (>80%) for more than 15 micropollutants compounds under summer conditions, e.g. diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, galaxolide, atenolol, ciprofloxacin, triclosan, glyphosate, ofloxacin and metoprolol. Hydraulic retention times (HRT) ranged from 0.25 to 30d. At HRT of 0.25d, only naproxen and atenolol were removed by >80% in summer, highlighting the importance of HRT for system performance. Another important factor influencing the removal is temperature and season with lower removal in winter. However, in warm climates (e.g. two studies in northern Spain and one study in southern France), reduction of removal efficiencies in winter is less pronounced with values for removal of the majority of investigated pharmaceuticals in winter still being >60%. In 4 FWS wetlands sampled during winter at sub-zero temperatures in Sweden, though, removal was mostly below 50%. A variety of removal mechanisms simultaneously occur in natural treatment systems and are relevant to varying extent for each compound and system type. Important removal mechanisms are biodegradation (e.g. for naproxen, ibuprofen), photodegradation (e.g. for diclofenac, ketoprofen, sulfamethoxazole) and adsorption (e.g. for galaxolide, tonalide). The relevance of plant uptake and phytodegradation as removal mechanisms is not fully understood; however, a few studies demonstrate the translocation of pharmaceuticals (e.g. carbamazepine) to plant tissue. For biodegradation, redox conditions are an important parameter influencing microbial degradation pathways. Design guidelines for eco-engineered treatment systems targeting the removal of micropollutants are not available to date. In addition, data necessary to dimension ecoengineered treatment systems that target the reduction of micropollutants in WWTP effluent (e.g. kinetic data such as removal rates and its dependence on temperature) is lacking. For the development of design guidelines for eco-engineered systems targeting the removal of micropollutants, removal rates for each system type and compound and their dependence from temperatures needs to be determined for all compounds of interest. Furthermore, more research is necessary for a deeper understanding of processes in eco-engineered systems, especially the relevance of the different removal mechanisms and conditions for removal for each individual micropollutant of interest. Nevertheless, eco-engineered treatment systems are a promising technology for polishing of WWTP effluent, including further removal of micropollutants.},

   abstract = {In recent years, organic micropollutants have been detected in urban storm runoff in several European studies. As rain water runoff in Berlin and other German and European cities is often discharged untreated in separated sewer systems, urban stormwater is a large potential source of micropollutants affecting receiving surface waters. As a consequence, it is important to know the local extent of the issue to be able to evaluate potential measures. In this study, a one year monitoring programme is conducted in the city of Berlin to estimate yearly loads of micropollutants from urban stormwater entering Berlin surface waters. Five different catchment types typical for Berlin were determined after analysis of GIS data (old building areas <1930, newer building areas >1950, single houses with gardens, roads and commercial areas) and monitoring points were selected fulfilling a number of criteria (including representativeness of catchment type, accessibility, sufficient flow, manhole size). Samples are taken using automatic samplers and a sampling strategy was developed to obtain best possible representative composite samples representing the average concentration of the sampled storm event. Results will then be used with measured flow data to calculate micropollutant loads of individual catchment types. A runoff model for Berlin applied to the individual catchment types and coupled with pollutant concentration relationships will be used to extrapolate results to city scale.},

Monitoring points were selected in five homogeneous catchments of different urban structure types to consider catchment-specific differences. Volume proportional samples (one composite sample per event) were analysed for a comprehensive set of ~100 micropollutants determined from literature review (e.g. plasticisers [phthalates], biocides/pesticides, flame retardants [organophosphates, polybrominated diphenylethers], PAH, heavy metals) as well as standard parameters (TSS, total P, phosphate, ammonium, COD, BOD). For selected storm events, time resolved samples were analysed to investigate the concentration dynamics and evaluate first flush characteristics. Results of event mean concentrations show catchment-specific differences for the majority of detected micropollutants. Furthermore, results of time-resolved samples indicate that most parameters do not show clear first flush effects with concentrations of several micropollutants even remaining constant during the course of the storm event (e.g. mecoprop, carbendazim, TBEP).},

   abstract = {Regenwasserabfluss ist die größte unbehandelte Quelle von potentiell hohen Spuren-stofffrachten in urbane Oberflächengewässer. In Berlin werden ca. 74% oder jährlich 44 Millionen m³ des Regenwasserabflusses weitgehend unbehandelt eingeleitet. Dies ent-spricht etwa 5% des jährlichen Abflusses der Stadtspree an der Mündung in die Havel. Erste Studien aus der Schweiz und Frankreich zu ausgewählten organischen Spurenstoffen (z.B. Biozide, Kunststoffinhaltsstoffe, Verbrennungsprodukte) im Regenwasserabfluss und Oberflächengewässern zeigen zum Teil hohe Konzentrationen von Substanzen mit möglicher Relevanz für aquatische Organismen oder die mensch-liche Nutzung.
Mit Überarbeitung der Liste der prioritären Stoffe der EU Wasserrahmenrichtlinie, die schon eine Regelung bzgl. polyzyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen (PAK) enthält, werden voraussichtlich weitere regenwasserbürtige Spurenstoffe (z.B. Terbutryn) gesetzlich geregelt. Eine Reduktion der Belastung von Oberflächengewässern mit organischen Spurenstoffen wird aktuell im urbanen Bereich vor allem durch weiterführende Behandlungsschritte an Klärwerken angestrebt. Der Erfolg dieser Anstrengungen könnte allerdings durch hohe unbehandelte Frachten im Regen-wasserabfluss eingeschränkt werden. Sollte sich der Regenwasserabfluss in einer Berliner Gesamtbetrachtung als relevanter Pfad von organischen Spurenstoffen erweisen, wäre daher unter Umständen eine Anpassung oder Erweiterung der aktuellen Vermeidungsstrategie notwendig. Das Forschungsprojekt OgRe soll die Spurenstoffstrategie Berlins unterstützen durch (i) eine Stoffliste lokal relevanter Substanzen im Regenwasserabfluss, (ii) eine Abschätzung jährlicher Frachten dieser Spurenstoffe über Regenwasserabfluss in die Berliner Ober-flächengewässer und (iii) einen Vergleich mit relevanten Stofffrachten aus anderen Pfaden. Dazu wurde ein Monitoringprogramm an insgesamt 6 verschiedenen Standorten aufgebaut, das sich momentan am Ende der Testphase befindet. Der vorliegende Zwischenbericht gibt einen Überblick über Kriterien der Messstellen-auswahl, Charakterisierung der unterschiedlichen Einzugsgebiete, Probenahmestrategie und Installation, erste Ergebnisse der Durchflussmessungen sowie Modellierungsansätze.},

   abstract = {A study is conducted to determine the relevance of micropollutants in urban stormwater runoff. To evaluate for the first time city-wide annual loads of stormwater-based micropollutants entering urban surface waters, an event-based, one-year monitoring program was set up in separate storm sewers in Berlin. Monitoring points were selected in 5 catchments of different urban structures (old building areas <1930, newer building areas >1950, single houses with gardens, roads >7500 vehicles/day and commercial areas) to consider catchment-specific differences. Storm events of different characteristics were sampled up to four hours during different seasons by automatic samplers triggered by flow meters. Volume-proportional samples (one composite sample per event) were analysed for a set of 100 parameters including 85 organic micropollutants (e.g. flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides/biocides, PAH), heavy metals and standard parameters. So far (70/88 samples), 60 organic micropollutants were at least once detected in stormwater runoff of the investigated catchment types. Concentrations were highest for phthalates with average concentrations of 13 µg/L for diisodecyl phthalate. For heavy metals, concentrations were highest for zinc (average: 950 µg/L). Results also showed catchment-specific differences for many compounds as well as seasonal differences for selected pollutants which can be used to improve micropollutant strategies and potentially prevent loads at the source.},

   abstract = {Diffuse nitrate (NO3-) contamination from intense agriculture adversely impacts freshwater ecosystems, and can also pose a risk to human health if receiving surface waters are used for drinking water production. Implementation of near-natural mitigation zones such as reactive swales or wetlands have been proven to be promising measures to reduce nitrate loads in agricultural drainage waters. However, the behaviour of these systems at low temperatures and its dependence on system design is not well known until now. In this part of the Aquisafe project, the behaviour of a full scale (length: 45 m) infiltration ditch and two parallel wetlands (surface flow wetland and infiltration wetland) treating drainage water of two agricultural watersheds in Brittany (France) with high nitrate concentrations in the receiving river, were constructed and monitored for 3 flow seasons in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to evaluate field scale performance of these systems. As the flow in both sites is usually restricted to winter and spring months (December – May), systems usually operate at low water temperatures of 5°C - 10°C. Tracer tests revealed shorter than designed retention times (average values for whole flow season 2013: 1.1 h for infiltration ditch, 4.3 h for infiltration wetland and 8.4 h for surface wetland) due to high inflows and preferential flow. This likely is the main reason for observed low average retention of nitrate loads of 1.5-3% during the whole flow season. However, increase of relative nitrate retention to up to 80% during low flow conditions at the end of flow season in May with higher HRT and increasing temperatures show that investigated systems generally work. Results show a stronger correlation between residence time and nitrate reduction for all three systems compared to correlation with temperature. Retention times necessary in existing systems to achieve nitrate retention >30% were 1 day for infiltration ditch and 3 days for wetlands. Performance was compared to results of two technical scale reactive swales (length: 8 m) operated for 1.5 years at two different residence times (0.4 and 2.5 days), situated at a test site of the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Berlin (Germany). Similar nitrate reduction was observed for comparable temperature and HRT values (during low flow conditions at end of flow season 2013), showing that up-scaling is a suitable approach to transfer knowledge gathered from technical scale experiments to field conditions. For the design of new mitigation systems, expected inflow volumes have to be investigated carefully in advance to ensure a sufficient residence time for effective nitrate reduction at low temperatures.},

   abstract = {Germany’s municipal sewage treatment plants generate some two million tons of dry sewage sludge annually, with the proportion of thermally treated sewage sludge increasing from 31.5 per cent in 2004 to more than 54 % in 2011. Sludge, which is usually incinerated or used as agricultural fertilizer, contains a whole series of harmful substances that complicate the task of sludge management. But sludge also contains a number of nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium. Hence the goal of sewage sludge management is to remove sludge pollutants while retaining sludge nutrients. Sewage sludge undergoes thermal recycling at facilities such as sewage sludge mono-incineration plants, cement plants and coal fired power plants. Sewage sludge utilization for farming purposes has plateaued of late (2006 to 2011) at around 29 %, an evolution attributable to more stringent quality standards for sewage sludge. However, sewage sludge is set to take on greater importance as a raw material, mainly due to the increased concentrations of phosphorous it contains. This pamphlet discusses the potential offered by sewage sludge and the ways it can be used sustainably. The pamphlet also describes the current status of sewage sludge management in Germany, with particular emphasis on the extent to which sludge use as a fertilizer can be reduced without foregoing phosphorous and other sludge nutrients. Over the next one to two decades, Germany needs to wean itself away from using sewage sludge for farming and at the same time efficiently leveraging the potential for using sewage sludge as a low cost fertilizer.},

   abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales – native species as well as alien species from tropical regions – were found to increase in many Brandenburg lakes while the formerly dominating microcystin (MC) producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis and Planktothrix) occurred less often and in lower amounts. As a consequence, lower MC concentrations were observed while the toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) that is produced by Nostocales was found to be widely distributed and to exceed sometimes the recommended guideline value for drinking-water of 1 μg L-1. Recent data on the occurrence of further neurotoxins (paralytic shellfish poisoningtoxin, PSP and anatoxin, ATX) produced by cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales did not exist. Nostocales are superior competitors under conditions of high light intensity and nitrogen depletion because they can fix molecular nitrogen. Their germination is regulated by temperature and the temporal starting point of the pelagic population determines the population size (the earlier the larger). Therefore, the following working hypothesis has been put forward: Combined effects of declining trophic state and global warming favor the development of Nostocales and cause a shift in the species composition as well as in the occurrences of cyanobacterial toxins. The NOSTOTOX project aimed to determine the present occurrence and future development of Nostocales and their toxins in waterbodies. Special emphasis was paid to answer the question, which Nostocales species and which toxins can be expected under conditions of a proceeding decline in trophic state and increasing water temperature. The outcome of the project aims to contribute to developing recommendations and guidelines for the management of inland waters and drinking water supplies.},

   abstract = {Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, an invasive freshwater cyanobacterium, originated from the tropics but has spread to temperate zones over the last few decades. Its northernmost populations in Europe occur in North German lakes. How such dramatic changes in its biogeography are possible and how its population dynamics in the newly invaded habitats are regulated are still unexplained. We therefore conducted a long-term (1993–2005) study of two German lakes to elucidate the mechanisms behind C. raciborskii population dynamics and to identify the abiotic constraints on its development. Our data revealed that pelagic populations of C. raciborskii thrived for three months during the summer, contributing up to 23% of the total cyanobacteria biovolume. Population sizes varied greatly between years without exhibiting any distinct long-term trends. In the annual lifecycle, C. raciborskii filaments emerged in the pelagic habitat when the temperature rose above 15–17 C. At that time, mean photosynthetically active radiation in the mixed water column (Imix) overstepped its maximum. Rates of population net increase were highest at the beginning of the season (0.15– 0.28 day–1), declined continuously over time, and were significantly positively correlated with Imix. This indicates that the onset of the pelagic population is temperaturemediated and that Imix controls its growth. Since Imix peaks before the population onset, the time of germination is of crucial importance for successful development. To test this hypothesis, we designed a model to simulate pelagic population size, starting at different dates in the annual cycle. Moving the population onset forward by 30 days resulted in a doubling of the population size. We therefore conclude that an earlier rise in water temperature associated with climate change has promoted the spread of C. raciborskii to the temperate zone. Earlier warming permits earlier germination, thereby shifting the pelagic populations to a phase with higher Imix, which advances growth and the population establishment.},

In Europe, only Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is identified as CYN producer so far and the seasonal variability of CYN was not studied yet. Therefore, we studied the seasonal dynamics of the particulate and dissolved CYN concentrations in relation to the cyanobacterial occurrence and environmental factors in two German lakes over two years. Total CYN reached maximum concentrations of 0.34 and 1.80 µg L-1 in Melangsee and Langer See, respectively. In both lakes, the dissolved CYN fraction peaked after the particulate fraction, and reached higher values indicating that CYN is poorly decomposed and accumulates in the water. The cyanobacterial community was very diverse in both lakes, including potentially CYN producing species such as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. However, these species could be excluded as the major CYN producers. The stronges significant correlation was found for Aphanizomenon gracile and CYN, strongly indicating that the species is the main CYN producer in Langer See. CYN was also correlated with Planktothrix agardhii in Langer See and Pseudanabaena limnetica in Melangsee, but species of the order  scillatoriales are not known to produce CYN. In Melangsee the CYN producer could not be identified. Different correlations of CYN with abiotic factors in the two lakes indicate the presences of further undetected CYN producers as well as different regulation mechanisms of their dynamic and the variability of CYN.},

The main objectives of the CYLIN project were therefore to analyze the distribution and regulation of C. raciborskii and cylindrospermopsin and to determine which cyanobacteria are producing this toxin in order to establish a basis with which to predict the further course of development of this species and the related health hazards for humans. The CYLIN project was implemented as a three-part program. A screening program was first conducted in 2004 to test regional water bodies for the presence of cylindrospermopsin and potential CYN-producing cyanobacteria in order to obtain an overview of their distribution in the study region. A total of 142 regional water bodies were sampled once each in this qualitative analysis cylindrospermopsin and cyanobacteria. The screening program was followed by a monitoring program designed to generate quantitative data on the concentrations of dissolved CYN, particulate CYN, cyanobacteria and target environmental parameters at 20 selected lakes, which were sampled 3 times each. Last but not least, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of these parameters at two selected lakes in 2004 and 2005. Apart from this we isolated different cyanobacterial strains and conducted chemical and molecular biological analyses of CYN and CYNcoding genes, in order to identify CYN-producing cyanobacteria. The results show that C. raciborskii and CYN are much more widespread than was previously assumed. C. raciborskii was detected in 22 % of the investigated water bodies, and cylindrospermopsin in 52 %. Additionally, two other toxic cyanobacteria of tropical origin were found for the first time in the BerlinBrandenburg region, Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides. The mean and maximum CYN concentrations were 1 µg L-1 and 12 µg L-1, respectively. Since the particulate CYN fraction did not exceed 0.5 µg L-1, the dissolved CYN fraction was found to be responsible for the high CYN concentrations. The proposed guideline safety value for cylindrospermopsin in drinking water (1 µg L-1) was exceeded 18 times at 8 different lakes. Although Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Nostocales) has been unequivocally identified as a producer of cylindrospermopsin, the observed cylindrospermopsin concentrations cannot be attributed to this cyanobacterial species alone. Aphanizomenon gracile was also identified as a potential CYN-producing cyanobacterium. Based on the findings of the CYLIN project, we recommend that cylindrospermopsin be included as a risk factor in drinking and bathing water quality assessments. To identify hazard conditions associated with this cyanotoxin, further investigations are needed to identify all cyanobacteria that produce cylindrospermopsin and to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the occurrence of CYN-producing cyanobacteria, CYN synthesis by these organisms, and CYN decomposition in aquatic ecosystems. Our analysis of C. raciborskii population dynamics showed that its germination is temperature-dependent and its population growth light-dependent. Population size was determined by the time of germination, that is, the earlier the time of germination, the bigger the population. Based on these findings, it appears highly likely that the climate-related early rise in water temperatures over the course of the years has promoted the spread of this species to temperate regions. Our hypothesis for the future course of cyanobacterial and cyanotoxin development in German waters is as follows: The combination of trophic decline and global warming works to the general benefit of cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales and leads to a shift in cyanobacterial species and toxin composition. This may ultimately lead to an increase in the incidence of neurotoxins as well as cylindrospermopsin.},

   abstract = {Ziel dieses Projektes ist es, zur Klärung der derzeitigen Verbreitung und Variabilität des toxischen Cyanobakteriums C. raciborskii und des Toxins Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) in Gewässern der Berliner Region beizutragen und eine Grundlage zu schaffen, auf welcher deren weitere Entwicklung und das damit verbundene Risiko für Mensch und Umwelt abgeschätzt werden kann. Die Verbreitung von C. raciborskii und CYN wurde in einem Pre-Screening Programm im Sommer 2004 untersucht. Für 142 Gewässer, die sich hinsichtlich Morphometrie, Trophie und Mixistypus unterscheiden, wurde die Zusammensetzung der Cyanobakterien einmalig qualitativ und semi-quantitativ analysiert sowie der CYN Gehalt des Sestons ermittelt. C. raciborskii wurde in 27,5 % der 142 untersuchten Gewässer nachgewiesen. Ihre relative Häufigkeit wurde überwiegend als vereinzelt (21,1 %) oder häufig (6,3 %) eingeschätzt. Massenentwicklungen der Art traten zum Zeitpunkt der Untersuchung nicht auf. Als typisches Habitat für C. raciborskii wurden flache eutrophe Gewässer mit niedriger Sichttiefe, und geringen Zeu/Zmix Verhältnissen analysiert. Entgegen bisheriger Annahmen ist die Art jedoch nicht auf Flachseen beschränkt, sondern kann auch in tiefen dimiktischen Gewässern Populationen etablieren. Darüber hinaus wurden vier weitere bedeutende Arten ermittelt. Raphidiopsis curvata und R. mediterranea, die in 5 von 142 Gewässern detektiert wurden. Von beiden Arten ist bekannt, dass sie CYN produzieren können. Anabaena bergii wurde vereinzelt bis häufig in 14,1 % der Gewässer nachgewiesen. Für diese Art wurde der gleiche Habitattyp wie für C. raciborskii festgestellt. Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides wurde vereinzelt bis häufig in 13,4 % der Gewässer nachgewiesen. Bei beiden Arten handelt es sich wie bei C. raciborskii um Neo-Cyanobakterien, die bisher nur aus tropischen bzw. subtropischen Regionen bekannt waren. Beide produzieren toxische Substanzen, die im Fall von A. aphanizomenoides noch nicht näher identifiziert werden konnten. Im Fall von A. bergii handelt es sich bei einem der Toxine um CYN. Zusammenfassend kann für die hier relevanten Arten festgestellt werden, dass sie weiter verbreitet sind als bisher bekannt war. Die Tatsache, dass C. raciborskii bisher in verhältnismäßig wenigen und A. bergii sowie A. aphanizomenoides bisher gar nicht für das Untersuchungsgebiet beschrieben wurden, wird u.a. auf taxonomische Unklarheiten zurückgeführt. Bislang wurden 96 Sestonproben aus 80 Gewässern auf CYN untersucht. In 63 % der Proben, bzw. 61 % der Seen wurde CYN in Konzentrationen zwischen 0,1 und 100 µg/g TG nachgewiesen und ist somit in Deutschland weiter verbreitet als bisher angenommen. Ein erster Vergleich der Cyanobakterienzusammensetzung mit dem CYNVorkommen zeigt, dass CYN in den untersuchten Gewässern nicht nur von C. raciborskii produziert wird, da es auch in Proben gemessen wurde, in denen die Art nicht nachgewiesen wurde. Derzeit werden die beiden oben beschriebenen Arten A. bergi und A. aphanizomenoides als weitere potentielle CYN-Produzenten in Betracht gezogen sowie eine Reihe weiterer Arten der Gattungen Anabaena und Aphanizomenon. Eine entgültige Klärung wird nach Abschluss der chemischen und molekularbiologischen Analysen der isolierten Stämme erwartet.},

   abstract = {Several kinds of managed aquifer recharge techniques provide very good purification of surface water since more than 100 years. In order to maintain a reliable supply of clean water, they are becoming increasingly popular all over the world. These methods require low technical effort. At Aquifer Storage and Recovery and ponded infiltration the recharged amounts are technically controlled. The infiltration water has to be pumped and often pretreated. At bank filtration this is dispensable, the approach, of using existing surface water bodies is even more consequent. Exemplarily, at a test site at Lake Tegel, Berlin, Germany, the hydraulic processes are modelled. By means of 3D long term regional and transient hydraulic modelling it was detected that the existing approaches for determining the leakance induce large errors in the water balance and describe the infiltration zone insufficiently. The leakance could be identified to be triggered by the groundwater table, causing air exchange and intrusion of atmospheric oxygen, which reduces clogging by altered redox conditions by at least one order of magnitude. This causes that changes of the groundwater table are mitigated much more than previously assumed. Taking these findings into account, a transient water balance is determined and bank filtration ratios are quantified. A new inverse modelling concept has been developed and applied to a 3D short term local and transient hydraulic model. It comprises spatially distributed pilot points and overparameterisation constrained by regularisation and calibration to head differences. Significance of the results is demonstrated by cross validation. With this approach the spatial distribution of an aquitard have been identified with high precision. The highly transient and heterogeneous flow conditions are specified and a new viewpoint on the geologic formation of Lake Tegel is obtained. The good fit of modelled and observed breakthrough curves of 18O, chloride and temperature by just using transferred parameters obtained with the previous hydraulic methods, show the very good model performance and predictive capabilities. The intrusion of atmospheric oxygen into the unsaturated zone is identified to be the principal redox determining factor during infiltration. Previously inconsistent and also local geochemical conditions are identified to be determined by interaction of infiltration processes with the spatial extent of the aquitard. A theory for chemical clogging of abstraction wells is developed, identifying the strong vertical redox zoning as principal factor of influence.},

   abstract = {The  combination  of  advanced  oxidation  (e.g.  ozonation)  and  subsurface  passage  could overcome known limitations of MAR techniques with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)  and  trace  organics  removal.  The  objective  of the  OXIRED  project  is  to  assess possibilities  and  limitations  as  well  as  practicability  and  technical  feasibility  of  different combinations  of  advanced  oxidation  and  subsurface  passage  with  respect  to  this  topic. As  part  of  the  first  project  phase,  existing  data  on  subsurface  removal  of  organic  trace substances  was  evaluated  in  order  to  identify  substances  that  should  be  targeted  in laboratory and technical scale experiments. This report summarizes the outcomes of this evaluation.
For  the  identification  of  substances  to  be  targeted  in  laboratory  and  technical  scale experiments,  a  literature  survey  was  carried  out  on  substances  that  are  potentially persistent  during  subsurface  passage.  The  basis  for  this  survey  was  an  extensive, publicly  available  data  base  on  the  behaviour  of  trace  organics  during  natural  drinking water  treatment  (bank  filtration,  aquifer  recharge,  slow  sand  filtration)  compiled  by  the Schmidt  (2005)  at  the  German  Technology  Center  for Water  (TZW).  This  data  was supplemented  by  results  published  by  Stuyvzand  et  al.  (2007)  and  a  comprehensive analysis of NASRI data carried out at the KWB (Wiese et al. 2009).
For the 45 potentially persistent substances (for which only little removal had been stated in  at  least  one  of  the  mentioned  sources)  a  comprehensive  evaluation  on  potential  for breakthrough in subsurface treatment systems was carried out. In addition, experts from BWB  and  Veolia  were  asked  to  classify  the  substances  with  respect  to  relevance (occurrence, persistence) in their respective water supply systems. The result was a list of 20 possible target substances, of which 4 were rated as 1st priority, due to the fact that they  i)  showed  a  high  potential  for  breakthrough  in  subsurface  treatment  systems,  ii) were classified as highly relevant by either BWB or Veolia (or both), iii) are not efficiently removed  by  advanced  post-treatment  techniques  (e.g.  GAC)  and  iv)  for  which  an analytical   method   is   available   at   BWB.   These   1st   priority   substances   for   further investigations are: MTBE, sulfamethoxazole, EDTA and ETBE. 
Possible  target  substances  of  2nd  priority  are:  carbamezipine, primidone, 1,5-NDSA, iopamidole, bentazone, 1,7-NDSA, 2,7-NDSA, atrazine, desethylatrazine, linuron, diuron, diclofenac, amidotrizoic  acid  (italics  indicate  substances,  for  which  there  is  currently  no analytical method available at BWB.
In  addition,  it  is  recommended  to  investigate  the  behavior  of the  sum  parameter  AOI  in the  experiments,  encompassing  all  iodinated  contrast  media  which  in  total  can  not  be determined as individual substances.

   abstract = {Managed aquifer recharge provides efficient removal for many organic water constituents but it is a difficult task to quantify removal under field conditions: Observed concentrations often scatter and may be biased by subsurface mixing of different waters. Removal efficiency is affected by different environmental parameters, such as redox potential, travel times, threshold values, and also field site specifics. In addition, it is crucial to know the corresponding surface water concentration for all samples. We developed a method, which overcomes these difficulties, quantifies the efficiency and removal kinetics and is applicable to extensive databases. It combines both, statistical and graphical evaluation which allows the determination of precise values and also interpretation based on expert knowledge. The database of this study was collected within the NASRI project between 2002 and 2005 at two bank filtration sites (Tegel BF, Wannsee BF) and one basin aquifer recharge site (Tegel AR) in Berlin. In total, 38 organic constituents were analysed (Table 1).},

   abstract = {Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) provides efficient removal for many organic compounds and sum parameters. However, observed in situ removal efficiencies tend to scatter and cannot be predicted easily. In this paper, a method is introduced which allows to identify and eliminate biased samples and to quantify simultaneously the impact of (i) redox conditions (ii) kinetics (iii) residual threshold values below which no removal occurs and (iv) field site specifics. It enables to rule out spurious correlations between these factors and therefore improves the predictive power. The method is applied to an extensive database from three MAR field sites which was compiled in the NASRI project (2002e2005, Berlin, Germany). Removal characteristics for 38 organic parameters are obtained, of which 9 are analysed independently in 2 different laboratories. Out of these parameters, mainly pharmaceutically active compounds (PhAC) but also sum parameters and industrial chemicals, four compounds are shown to be readily removable whereas six are persistent. All partly removable compounds show a redox dependency and most of them reveal either kinetic dependencies or residual threshold values, which are determined. Differing removal efficiencies at different field sites can usually be explained by characteristics (i) to (iii).},

They offer significant advantages compared to conventional mercury lamps due to their compact form factor, low power requirements, high efficiency, non-toxicity, and overall robustness. However, despite the significant progress in the performance of semiconductor based UV LEDs that has been achieved in recent years, these devices still suffer from low emission power and relatively short lifetimes. Even the best UV LEDs exhibit external quantum efficiencies of only 1e2%. The objective of this study was to investigate the suitability of GaN-based UV LEDs for water disinfection. The investigation included the evaluation of the performance characteristics of UV LEDs at different operating conditions as well as the design of a UV LED module in view of the requirements for water treatment applications. Bioanalytical testing was conducted using Bacillus subtilis spores as test organism and UV LED modules with emission wavelengths of 269 nm and 282 nm. The results demonstrate the functionality of the developed UV LED disinfection modules. GaN-based UV LEDs effectively inactivated B. subtilis spores during static and flow-through tests applying varying water qualities. The 269 nm LEDs reached a higher level of inactivation than the 282 nm LEDs for the same applied fluence. The lower inactivation achieved by the 282 nm LEDs was compensated by their higher photon flux. First flow-through tests indicate a linear correlation between inactivation and fluence, demonstrating a well designed flow-through reactor. With improved light output and reduced costs, GaN-based UV LEDs can provide a promising alternative for decentralised and mobile water disinfection systems.},

   abstract = {Für die Klärschlammbehandlung und -entsorgung von vier Kläranlagen (Ruhleben, Waßmannsdorf, Schönerlinde und Münchehofe) in Berlin wurden Energie- und Treibhausgasbilanzen jeweils mit und ohne Einbindung der Hydrothermalen Karbonisierung (HTC) erstellt. Als Methode diente die Ökobilanz mittels der Software Umberto 5.6. Hierzu wurden Stoffstrommodelle zur Quantifizierung der relevanten Stoff- und Energieströme bei der Schlammbehandlung, Prozesswasserbehandlung und Faulgasverwertung jeweils ohne und mit HTC (Reaktor, Entwässerung, Prozesswasserrückführung in Faulung bzw. Klärwerk) erstellt. Als Input-Daten dienten Messwerte der BWB, Laborversuche und Herstellerangaben. Aus den Ergebnissen wurden der kumulierte fossile Energieaufwand und das Treibhauspotential berechnet. Neben der Frage, inwieweit und durch welche wesentlichen Parameter die HTC die Bilanzen verbessert, wurde die Auswirkung der Ansäuerung bei der HTC, der Unterschied zwischen zwei HTC-Verfahren (TerraNova- und AVA-CO2) sowie die Ergebnisse einiger Pilotversuche hinsichtlich der Bilanzen ausgewertet. Bei den Klärwerken mit Faulung wurde eine deutliche Verbesserung der Energieund Treibhausgasbilanz durch die HTC bei Annahme einer guten Entwässerbarkeit (TR 65 %) festgestellt, in Ruhleben allerdings nur bei Ergänzung einer anaeroben HTC-Prozesswasserbehandlung mit Faulgasnutzung, dafür jedoch mit der größten Verbesserung. Hier kann der HTC-Wärmebedarf durch effiziente BHKWAbwärmenutzung zu 35 % gedeckt werden, bei den übrigen Klärwerken sind es >90 %. Die Verbesserung der Bilanzen kommt primär durch die zusätzliche Stromproduktion bzw. Braunkohlesubstitution bei der Verbrennung infolge des höheren Heizwertes, die Stromgewinnung durch das zusätzliche Faulgas (+16-19 %) und die reduzierten N2O-Emissionen bei der Monoverbrennung zustande. Die Coverbrennung zeigt stets deutlich bessere Energiebilanzen als die Monoverbrennung. Die Ansäuerung bei der HTC bewirkt eine geringere Methanausbeute aus dem Prozesswasser sowie eine geringe HTC-Kohle-Massenausbeute und damit eine Verschlechterung der Bilanzen. Bezüglich der Ursachen besteht noch Klärungsbedarf. Das AVA-CO2-Verfahren hat nur eine geringfügige Methanausbeute, verbunden mit einem höheren Erdgasbedarf, jedoch einen höheren Heizwert und Massenausbeute der HTC-Kohle. Dadurch ist es dem TerraNova-Verfahren hinsichtlich der Bilanzen nur bei der Coverbrennung überlegen, bei der Monoverbrennung ist es umgekehrt. In den Pilotversuchen fiel der Entwässerungsgrad geringer aus als angenommen (TS 44-51 %). Dadurch sinkt der nutzbare Heizwert und die Bilanzen verschlechtern sich entsprechend. Weitere Pilotversuche sind empfehlenswert. Refraktäre Verbindungen im Prozesswasser verursachen eine zusätzliche CSBBelastung des Ablaufs (+7-12 mg/l). In Waßmannsdorf würde der Überwachungswert überschritten, in den übrigen Klärwerken würde er im Mittel eingehalten.},

Results show that both AirPrex® configurations with 1 reactor and 3 reactor have positive energy benefits and better environmental credits for the global warming potential (GWP), freshwater eutrophication potential, and marine eutrophication potential. The 3-reactor configuration shows better results in cumulative energy demand with 35% improvement of energy surplus, 36% reduction of GWP and less eutrophication potential. These improvements are mainly due to optimized struvite precipitation and harvesting and show that technology can be developed further, especially in plant operation and not only in the laboratory or pilot plant.},

   abstract = {Das Verbundprojekt „TestTools“ hat vielfältige Untersuchungen zur Verwendbarkeit unterschiedlicher Testmethoden hinsichtlich des Spurenstoffverhaltens in natürlichen und technischen Barrieren durchgeführt. Entsprechend der gewonnenen Ergebnisse können die folgenden knapp zusammengefassten Aussagen getätigt werden. Zur Pulveraktivkohle-(PAK)-Dosierung im Labor sollten benetzte, entgaste Stammsuspensionen, die in Reinstwasser angesetzt werden, in Verbindung mit Laborpipetten verwendet werden; mit geringem Zusatzaufwand können dabei auch der PAK-Wasser- und -Aschegehalt bestimmt werden. Die Kontaktherstellung mit der Testflüssigkeit sollte auf eindimensionalen Horizontalschüttlern erfolgen. Der Surrogatparameter UV254nm-Absorption eignet sich in den meisten Fällen unabhängig von der PAK-Sorte zur Prognose der Spurenstoffentfernung. Die neuartige Initialisierung des Equivalent Background Compound Models (EBCM) mittels Wasserqualitätsparametern (z. B. DOC) wurde validiert. Methylorange eignet sich als definiertes Surrogat für Adsorptionskonkurrenz durch Hintergrundorganik. UV254 eignet sich auch für kontinuierlich betriebene, großskalige Pilot- und Großanlagen zur Kontrolle und Überwachung der Spurenstoffentfernung. Eine Batchprozedur zur Vorhersage von Spurenstoffentfernungen auf PAK-Rezirkulations-Großanlagen wird vorgeschlagen. Rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) werden im Vergleich mit großskaligen Daten trotz einiger Einschränkungen als geeignete Methode für schnelle und verlässliche Tests mit granulierter Aktivkohle (GAK) bestätigt. Größere RSSCTs bringen weniger Einschränkungen aber einen deutlich höheren Aufwand mit sich. GAK-Batchtests sind nur bedingt geeignet. Integrale Durchbruchskurven unterliegen deutlich weniger Schwankungen als direkte („aktuelle“) Durchbruchskurven. Abgleiche zwischen den Durchbrüchen in verschiedenen Wässern können mittels Auftragungen über spezifische Durchsätze von bestimmten Wasserqualitätsparametern (aus der größenausschluss-chromatographischen Trennung des DOC) erreicht werden. Surrogatparameter wie UV254 eignen sich nur bedingt zur Vorhersage, insbesondere bei stark adsorbierenden Spurenstoffen. Die Nützlichkeit künstlicher Surrogatparameter muss noch geklärt werden. Ozon-Laborversuche im Batch bzw. Semi-Batch-Methoden liefern vergleichbare Ergebnisse hinsichtlich der Spurenstoffelimination, haben jedoch unterschiedliche Vor- und Nachteile bei der praktischen Umsetzung. Der Feststoffeinfluss auf die ozon-induzierte Spurenstoffelimination ist gering und erst ab ca. 20 mg/L Trockensubstanz relevant. Temperatur und pH-Wert haben ebenfalls wenig bis keinen Einfluss; allerdings beeinflussen sie die ermittelten Ozonzehrungsverläufe. Über die UV254-Absorption (SAK254) können gute Vorhersagen der Spurenstoffelimination getätigt werden. Die Bromatbildung fiel in Batch- und Semi-Batch-Versuchen teils unterschiedlich aus; die Bildung von Bromat oder NDMA wird gegenüber Pilot- oder großtechnischen Anlagen tendenziell überschätzt. Von 18 kommunalen Kläranlagen wurden die Eliminationen verschiedener Spurenstoffe bzw. des delta SAK254 bezüglich des spez. Ozoneintrags ermittelt, was für Referenzzwecke nutzbar ist. Interne OH-Radikaltracer waren in allen 18 untersuchten Kläranlagen anzutreffen, was zur Ermittlung der OH-Radikalexposition als auch zur Qualitätssicherung genutzt werden kann. Die Modellierung basierend auf Ozon- und OH-Radikalexposition führte zu teils deutlichen Überschätzungen der Spurenstoffelimination. Die Ergebnisse einer Umfrage zeigen eine überwiegend sehr gute Informationslage bei den Stakeholdern. Zur biologischen Nachbehandlung des ozonierten Klarlaufs wird von den befragten Personen der Einsatz von Filtersystemen, insbesondere solchen mit granulierter Aktivkohle, empfohlen. Aufgrund der sehr komplexen Zusammenhänge in naturnahen biologischen Barrieren, wie beispielsweise der Uferfiltration oder der künstlichen Grundwasseranreicherung, sind schnelle Testmethoden nur bedingt aussagekräftig. Erkenntnisse der letzten Jahre deuten darauf hin, dass kleine Unterschiede in der Verfügbarkeit von Sauerstoff oder biologisch verfügbarem organischen Kohlenstoff bereits erhebliche Unterschiede in der Elimination bestimmter organischer Spurenstoffe haben. Neben den chemischen Parametern hat die Zusammensetzung der Mikrobiozönose einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Abbauleistung. Insgesamt eignen sich einfach durchzuführende Laborschnelltests daher nicht, die hohe Komplexität naturnaher Untergrundprozesse darzustellen. Lediglich eine gute Abbaubarkeit unter oxischen Verhältnissen lässt sich vergleichsweise gut anhand von Kleinsäulentests im Labormaßstab abbilden.},

   abstract = {The spatial distribution of confining layers within a system of two aquifers strongly affects the hydraulics and sensitivity to pollution. The test site is located close to a well field. Wells are switched with short intervals and hydraulic heads are recorded in several observation wells. Because the absolute levels of simulated hydraulic heads do not always coincide with the measurements, the model is calibrated with short term head variations. The characteristic shape of the hydraulic heads at each observation wells contains sensitive information about the structure of the aquifer. A numerical technique is developed which enables to simulate the spatial distribution of the confining layer. The method comprises the use of pilot points and regularisation technique. Cross validation is carried out in order to show the results are physically based. The method is shown to provide significant results even under non optimal conditions.},

   abstract = {The removal of trace organic compounds through membrane bioreactors (MBR) in comparison to a conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a long term study was investigated. Two MBR pilot plants were operated in parallel to a full-scale WWTP, fed with the same municipal raw waste water. Bulk organic parameters such as COD and TOC, high polar compounds (phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and carbamazepine), and less polar estrogenic steroids (estradiol, estrone and ethinylestradiol) were quantified. The removal rate of phenazone, propyphenazone and formylaminoantipyrine by the conventional WWTP was below 15 %. Significant higher removal rates (60-70 %) started to be clearly monitored with the pilot plants after about 5 months. The removal of the drug metabolite acetylaminoantipyrine during conventional treatment was below 30 % and reached 70 % in both pilot plant. Higher removal rates coincided here with higher temperatures at the summer time. Carbamazepine was not removed during conventional and membrane activated sludge treatment.The conventional WWTP removed in average more than 90 % of the natural steroids estrone and estradiol and about 80 % of the synthetic ethinylestradiol. The elimination of estradiol and estrone by the MBR processes were of about 99 % and Ethinylestradiol was removed by about 95 %.},

Verschiedene Studien zeigten, dass abwasserbürtige Verbindungen zum Teil nicht oder nicht vollständig durch die Behandlung des Abwassers entfernt werden (Heberer, 2002; Ternes, 1998; Daughton and Ternes, 1999). Somit  können unter anderem Humanpharmazeutika und deren Metabolite über Kläranlagenabläufe in die aquatische Umwelt gelangen. Da die Wirkschwelle solcher Verbindungen zum Teil schon in sehr geringer Konzentration erreicht wird (z.B. Ethinylestradiol - Purdom et al., 1994) oder die Datenlage hierzu unzureichend ist, gewinnt die Entfernung der Spurenstoffe während der Abwasserbehandlung immer mehr an Bedeutung. Membranbelebungsanlagen könnten hier einen verbesserten Rückhalt bewirken. Neben der biologischen Phosphor- und Stickstoffentfernung (Gnirss et al., 2003; Lesjean et al., 2002) war es Ziel dieses Forschungsprojektes, die Entfernung von ausgewählten organischen Spurenstoffen in zwei Membranbelebungsanlagen im Vergleich zu einem konventionellen Klärwerk zu untersuchen.},
