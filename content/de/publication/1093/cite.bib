  Abstract = {This deliverable describes Guidelines for design and operation of advanced primary treatment with microscreen. Technical speci-fications including pre-treatment, mesh size, hydraulic velocity, chemicals (substances, doses, contact times), operational re-quirements (backwash, cleaning) and operational performanc-es (removal rates, backwash sludge quantity and quality) are presented with data gained from the two Case study site trials in Westewitz (Germany) and Sjölunda (Sweden)..},
