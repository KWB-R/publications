  Abstract = {The aim of this master thesis was to investigate the transferability of the innovative treatment concept CARISMO on a full-scale wastewater treatment plant in a rural area. The idea of CARISMO is integrated in the EU-funded research project Powerstep and focuses on an increased separation of solid substances and their use for energy production with digestion. In the course of this work, principles and conditions for the change of occupancy were determined. Furthermore, preliminary tests were carried out to analyse the wastewater characteristics and the necessary resources for the projected flocculation and filtration stage. The technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the treatment concept has been shown with balances of material flows, energy and costs.},
