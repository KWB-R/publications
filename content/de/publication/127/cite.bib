 abstract = {In the course of the interdisciplinary research project NASRI (natural and artificial systems for recharge and infiltration) many investigations are currently being carried out to assess the risk of break through of persistent organic substances into raw water used for drinking water supply. One part of these studies is the determination of the transport behavior of pharmaceutical residues in test sand filters, so called enclosures, equipped with sampling points at various depths. Breakthrough curves were determined for carbamazepine, primidone (both antiepileptic drugs), clofibric acid (a metabolite of blood lipid lowering agents), diclofenac, ibuprofen (both analgesic drugs) and for chloride, used as a conservative tracer. Retardation coefficients and degradation rates were obtained by using the software Visual CXTFIT. Degradation rates between 0.7 h–1 and 1 h–1 were observed for ibuprofen whereas clofibric acid, primidone, carbamazepine and diclofenac showed no or very little degradation (lambda < 0.06 h–1).},
