abstract: "Circular Agronomics, aims to foster the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy. Therefore, this deliverable focuses on circular solutions for waste and wastewaters originating from the food industry. In 2019, the “Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for the Food, Drink and Milk Industries” (BREF-document) was published by the European Commission. Based on that, the deliverable summarizes the state of the art of the technologies already in use and concludes their suitability for circular economy solutions. In Circular Agronomics, new technologies for the recovery of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are developed and investigated. So far, those technologies are not included in the BREF-document yet. Therefore, the concepts of the technologies are introduced in the deliverable. For a potential integration of those technologies in the BREF-document, the technologies are described in detail in the annex according to the required structure in the BREF-document. However, since the technologies are still under development, those descriptions are considered as a first draft. The authors suggest to update those descriptions at a later stage of the project prior to their potential integration in the BREF-document. Referring to the goal to recover carbon and nutrients, the deliverable presents a detailed characterization of the waste and wastewaters originating from the food industries. Based on that, the five most promising waste and wastewater streams regarding carbon recovery, nitrogen recovery, phosphorus recovery and potassium recovery were selected. For those streams and the corresponding recovery technologies four new concepts are suggested in the deliverable. In order to show the technology providers an overview of potential clients for their technologies and for those concepts, for each selected industry, the European country with the highest production rate was chosen. For this country, the regional distribution of the certain industry was determined."
