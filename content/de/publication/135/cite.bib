  Abstract = {Hydrochemical conditions were evaluated at both bank filtration and artificial recharge sites in Berlin. All bank filtration sites show a strong vertical age stratification. Rather than showing a typical redox zoning with more reducing conditions in greater distance from the surface water, the redox zones are horizontally layered, with more reducing conditions in greater depth. This is believed to be an effect of the strongly alternating groundwaterlevels and by the age stratification. The redox conditions are generally more reducing at the bank filtration sites, mainly as a result of the longer travel times and operational differences. Redox conditions at all sites vary seasonally in particular at the artificial recharge site, which is mainly caused by temperature changes.},
