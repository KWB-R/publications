  Abstract = {The MBR technology is able to fulfil similar or even higher standard for nutrients removal than conventional activated sludge processes. This paper presents the results of a scheme constructed in a remote and yet unsewered area of Berlin requiring high quality wastewater treatment, and consisting of one containerised MBR unit together with a low pressure sewer. The process includes enhanced biological phosphorus removal and post-denitrification. In order to flatten out the hydraulic and load profile, and therefore to reduce the size of the biological reactor and the membrane surface, a buffer tank was installed before the MBR-plant. The full-scale MBR demonstration plant in Berlin-Margaretenhöhe or 250 p.e.(person equivalent) could be operated continuously by remote control and could fulfil high quality treatment for both disinfection and enhanced biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal, matching under design load conditions the effluent criteria of TP < 0.1 mgP/L and TN < 10 mgN/L ( 99% P- and 90% N-elimination).},
