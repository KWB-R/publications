abstract: "The secondary effluent of Berlin's sewage treatment plant Ruhleben was oxidized by dosages of 2.5-22 mg/L ozone and varying operation conditions to remove pharmaceutical compounds and disinfect water in parallel. The majority of analysed neutral and acidic drugs were efficiently removed to the detection limit at ozone consumptions equal to a dosage of < 10 mg/L O3. However, certain compounds like clofibric acid, ketaprofen and traced metabolites required higher dosages of > 10-15 mg/LO3 for complete removal. A series of four iodinated organic contrast media (ICM) persisted the ozone treatment even at high consumption rates. Related to disinfection, the legal requirements (EU bathing water directive) could be fulfilled by a consumption of < 10 mg/L O3. For a combined oxidation by ozone and H2O2 (perozone) higher conversion rates for clofibric acid, naproxen and ketaprofen could be obtained at lower dosage (6 mg/L O3). For two ICM, namely iopamidol and iohexol, this was the case at higher ozone consumption. The removal of adsorbable organic iodine (AOI) > 10% could not be achieved by any treatment. The initial genotoxicity of the secondary effluent was stated by four independent tests. Due to the application of ozone, this genotoxicity was completely removed. The presented results confirm that ozonation can be a suitable advanced wastewater treatment at varying operation conditions to lower effluent concentrations of pharmaceuticals and active micro-organsisms."
