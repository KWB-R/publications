  Abstract = {Riverbank filtration (RBF) denotes the process whereby river water is induced to infiltrate into a groundwater system by well operation adjacent to banks. In Central Europe, RBF has been common practice for 100 years to produce drinking water. Due to the easy implementation and little maintenance necessary, BF has been suggested to be a useful drinking water treatment for developing and newly-industrialised countries. Experience from Europe has demonstrated that RBF is suitable to remove a range of organic and inorganic contaminants while an exhaustion of cleaning capacity has not been observed. RBF systems can mitigate shock loads and are particularly known for the efficient removal of pathogens, suspended solids and algal toxins from surface water, all being water quality parameters of high relevance in developing and newly-industrialised countries. Another benefit of RBF operation is the storage capacity which may help to balance freshwater availability in areas experiencing high variations of precipitation and run-off. This report aims at evaluating the relevance and opportunities of RBF systems to provide safe water to these countries. In order to evaluate the relevance and opportunities of RBF systems to developing and newly-industrialised countries, the report is structured to address key considerations and (i) identify prerequisites for successful RBF operation based on the experience in Central Europe and the United States, (ii) assess the removal potential of RBF for various water contaminants based on available literature, the TECHNEAU investigations in India and NASRI data from Berlin and (iii) evaluate the sustainability and relevance of RBF operation with regard to the particular needs in developing and newly-industrialised countries.},
