abstract: "Indicator bacteria and coliphages along the transects of Lake Tegel, Lake Wannsee and the artificial recharge pond Tegel The indicator microorganisms, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, and coliphages were analysed in water samples from both transects for bank filtration at the Lakes Tegel and Wannsee as well as from the artificial recharge pond of Tegel. Surface water samples of both lakes were examined from May 2002 to December 2004. In addition, samples were analysed from four shallow observation wells and three pumping sites for drinking water supply along the transect Wannsee, as well as four deep and seven shallow observation wells and 2-3 pumping sites along the transect of Lake Tegel. Sampling at the artificial recharge pond of Tegel was carried out during four field surveys (August 2002-December 2002) in two shallow, three deep wells and one pumping well for drinking water supply. In addition, the microbial flora was studied in the sand filter of the recharge pond in Tegel."
