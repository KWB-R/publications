  Title = {Development of Toxic Nostocales (Cyanobacteria) in the Course of Declining Trophic State and Global Warming - NOSTOTOX Final Report},
  Year = {2011},
  Abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales – native species as well as alien species from tropical regions – were found to increase in many Brandenburg lakes while the formerly dominating microcystin (MC) producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis and Planktothrix) occurred less often and in lower amounts. As a consequence, lower MC concentrations were observed while the toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) that is produced by Nostocales was found to be widely distributed and to exceed sometimes the recommended guideline value for drinking-water of 1 µg L-1. Recent data on the occurrence of further neurotoxins (paralytic shellfish poisoningtoxin, PSP and anatoxin, ATX) produced by cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales did not exist. Nostocales are superior competitors under conditions of high light intensity and nitrogen depletion because they can fix molecular nitrogen. Their germination is regulated by temperature and the temporal starting point of the pelagic population determines the population size (the earlier the larger). Therefore, the following working hypothesis has been put forward: Combined effects of declining trophic state and global warming favor the development of Nostocales and cause a shift in the species composition as well as in the occurrences of cyanobacterial toxins. The NOSTOTOX project aimed to determine the present occurrence and future development of Nostocales and their toxins in waterbodies. Special emphasis was paid to answer the question, which Nostocales species and which toxins can be expected under conditions of a proceeding decline in trophic state and increasing water temperature. The outcome of the project aims to contribute to developing recommendations and guidelines for the management of inland waters and drinking water supplies.},
