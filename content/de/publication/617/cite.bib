  Year = {2013},
  Abstract = {Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a means to replenish aquifers in case of over-abstraction and store water, especially in regions with semi-arid or arid climate. For water re-use schemes MAR can offer additional treatment in the subsurface so the CO2-footprint can be reduced. Pre-treatment via ozonation and dual media filtration before infiltration of treated wastewater was studied to compare the obtained water quality to guidelines for water reuse. While the removal of bulk parameters such suspended solids or chemical oxygen demand were easily reduced by ozonation and filtration, the disinfection turned out to be the limiting process.},
