abstract: "The paper describes the planning process for the pilot implementation of a decision support system (dss) for global control of sewage pump stations in Berlin, which is going to be realised by the end of 2006. The objective of the control concept is to systematically manage in-pipe storage capacities in order to reduce cso. The paper presents the preliminary assessment of the systemâ€™s control potential based upon the analysis of operational figures and numerical simulations. Furthermore, the structure of the decision support systems procedure is illustrated."
