  Abstract = {Urban water infrastructures are increasingly facing challenges resulting from climate change and demographic developments. Using Berlin as an example, the project KURAS, which is supported by the Federal German Ministry for Education and Research, aims at demonstrating how the future waste water disposal, water quality, urban climate and quality of life in the city can be improved through intelligently coupled storm water and waste water management. The project consists of a network of partners from research and industry as well as Berlin decision makers (eight research institutions, four industrial partners, two public authorities and one public utility, responsible for drinking water supply and wastewater disposal).},
