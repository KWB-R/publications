 abstract = {This paper presents the results on the occurrence and fate of antibiotic residues during bankfiltration obtained from a study carried out in terms of an interdisciplinary project at three transects in Berlin, Germany. Six antibiotic compounds and two metabolites were detected at ng/L concentrations in water samples from the lakes or in the monitoring wells of the transects. Clarithromycin, roxithromycin (macrolide), trimethoprim (synergist for sulfonamides) and acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (metabolite) are efficiently removed by bank filtration. Residues of clindamycin (lincosamid) and dehydro-erythromycin (metabolite) were completely attenuated during the soil passage. For sulfamethoxazole (sulfonamide), a significant but not complete removal during bank filtration was observed. It was the only compound that could be detected at tracelevels in samples collected from water-supply wells.},
