  Year = {2003},
  Abstract = {The city of Berlin is using bank filtered surface water and artificially recharged water for drinking water production. As far as some hydrological trends and development of anthropogenic pollutants may threat the future of the ground water resource in Berlin, it is important to measure the capacity of ground filtration to answer to such developments, and to secure the use of this systems through the development of the most appropriate practices and the related technologies. This was an obvious reason to initiate a multidisciplinary cooperation project at the Berlin Centre of Competence with the topic "bank filtration and artificial recharge" named Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration (NASRI). It will focus, for example on questions of the emergence and removal of pharmaceutical residues during bank filtration. The fate and the destination of other specific trace substances as well as of bacteria and viruses are other objectives of the research programme (KWB 2002).},
