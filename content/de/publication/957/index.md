abstract: "Deterioration modelling has been developed in the last decades to support operators and municipalities in defining mid-long term asset management strategies with limited availability of sewer condition data (CCTV). Modelling can help validating and showing the viability of current strategies or provide information to justify the relevance of additional investments and expenditures. Several modelling approaches are now available but not commonly used by sewer operators and municipalities to support strategies mainly because of the lack of real scale demonstration of the tangible benefits provided. Indeed, most of these models fail to show that they can adequately forecast future conditions (Ana and Bauwens, 2010; Scheidegger et al., 2011; WERF, 2012)."
