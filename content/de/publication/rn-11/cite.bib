 abstract = {Real-time control of urban drainage systems allows activating capacities of storm water storage and wastewater treatment that were not used before. The historically developed structure of the Berlin combined sewerage, along with its aforementioned properties, allows per se a systematic management of the sub-systems. In the course of rehabilitation works the implementation of local regulators already opened additional storage reserves. Additionally, the potential of global control concepts for sewerage, pump stations and treatment plants is studied within the framework of the project “Integrated Sewage Management” to increase the systems efficiency. Especially, a coordination of the currently locally controlled pump stations entails a reduction of sewer overflows and hence an enhanced protection of the environment. For the catchment of wwtp Berlin-Ruhleben an integrated model of the collection system, pump stations, pressurised mains and the wwtp itself has been built up in order to evaluate different scenarios of global pump station control in comparison to a local control scenario (reference). Special attention was paid to the discharges from CSOs. Due to the high dynamic of these events and the high fraction of biodegradable organic substrate within the effluents, the impact on the water body over this path plays an important role. Concerning CSOs a maximum reduction of 14 % (COD load) and 20 % (TKN load) could be achieved. In conclusion it can be stated that a reduction of total emissions from the sewage system can be achieved by operating the pump stations in a global control mode. Furthermore, the main improvement can be observed for the discharges from combined sewer overflows.},
