abstract: "The  combination  of  advanced  oxidation  (e.g.  ozonation)  and  subsurface  passage  could overcome known limitations of MAR techniques with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)  and  trace  organics  removal.  The  objective  of the  OXIRED  project  is  to  assess possibilities  and  limitations  as  well  as  practicability  and  technical  feasibility  of  different combinations  of  advanced  oxidation  and  subsurface  passage  with  respect  to  this  topic. As  part  of  the  first  project  phase,  existing  data  on  subsurface  removal  of  organic  trace substances  was  evaluated  in  order  to  identify  substances  that  should  be  targeted  in laboratory and technical scale experiments. This report summarizes the outcomes of this evaluation."
