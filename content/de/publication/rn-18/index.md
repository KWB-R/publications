abstract: "The complete utilization of the capacities of a complex sewage system, consisting of networks, storage and control assets, pressurized network and waste water treatment plants, especially for storm weather events is a central task to minimize the pollutant load discharged in the receiving waters. With the objective of a minimization of water pollution load within the urban area of Berlin (Germany) the project “Integrated Sewage Management” has been launched in 2000. The central points of this project are the application of integrated simulation tools for the examination of different management scenarios and after that the definition and installation of an integrated operation concept for the system. This paper presents a first phase of the project, the modelling of the combined sewerage system of a pilot catchment area in the center of Berlin, results of simulation mainly focused on the real time control potential of the system and first steps of transferring this into an operation concept."
