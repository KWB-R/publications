 abstract = {Wet weather discharges from urban catchments are widely recognised as a major cause of unsatisfactory receiving water quality. Among stormwater discharges the impact from combined sewer overflows (CSO) plays a prominent role. The dynamic character of the discharge events lead to particular stress on the water bodies. Legal requirements for CSO follow the precautionary principle and usually set emission standards. Within the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC of May 1991 it is written that “member states shall decide on measures to limit pollution from storm water overflows”. The directive does not give standards but solely proposes that “such measures could be based on dilution rates or capacity in relation to dry weather flow, or could specify a certain acceptable number of overflows per year”. The European Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC of October 2000 goes beyond and asks for a combined approach to river basin management. On the source side, it requires that all existing technology-driven source-based controls must be implemented as a first step. On the effects side, it provides a new overall objective of good status for all waters, and requires that where the measures taken on the source side are not sufficient to achieve these objectives, additional ones are required. To assess the impact of CSO on the Berlin receiving water the research projects MONITOR and SAM-CSO are carried out in cooperation between Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe and the Senate Department of Environment Berlin. The objective of the projects is to identify and make available receiving water parameters (immission parameters) for the decision making process concerning the optimisation of the urban drainage system. Further on, a method for the evaluation of measures of combined water treatment on the basis of these immission criteria will be defined. The evaluation shall be based on both, available measurement data from the sewer system and the receiving water and simulations with an integrated model for the coupled drainage-river-system. The paper will present the methodology of the project. Special focus is on the description of the processes within the Berlin water bodies (stagnant lowland rivers) and the compilation of relevant physical-chemical and ecological parameters for the assessment of CSO.},
