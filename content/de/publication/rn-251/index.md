abstract: "After extending the sewage networks in the 1990s, the focus is now on reducing the overflows from combined sewers in storm weather, which create serious problems (fish death, beach closure, etc.). To protect the particularly sensitive surface waters of Berlin, on whose quality the drinking water supply inderectly depends, KompetenzZentrum Wasser Berlin, on behalf of Berliner Wasserbetriebe and Veolia Water, realises the project Integrated Sewage Management. In-pipe storage of combined waters during storm weather is tested on the basis of a model of the whole sewage system. But slowing the flow causes the suspended load to sediment, thus its transport in the network has to be simulated. This report presents a short review of sediment transport in fluvial hydraulics and in urban drainage, as well as an application on a small storm water network with software InfoWorks CS 4.5."
