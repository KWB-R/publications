abstract: "Access to microbiologically and chemically safe water is limited not only in developing countries, but also in transition countries and even in remote areas of developed countries. For these cases, decentralized water supply concepts such as point-of-use (POU), point-of-entry (POE) or small-scale system (SSS) technologies can be promising alternatives to centralized treatment concepts. Membrane-based treatment systems have gained importance for drinking water treatment in the developed countries. In principle, application of membrane technology is attractive also for the transition and developing countries, because it provides absolute barriers for control of hygienic hazards (Ultrafiltration (UF)) and because the modular construction enables implementation on each possible scale size. However membrane technology is still not affordable for the poorest part of the world population. The sustainable application of POU membrane system presumes that system should be operated without or with limited addition of chemicals, with limited possibility of regular backflushing and with low pressure, presumably hydrostatic. On the other hand, while the water needs for drinking and cooking for a family of four people constitute approx. 20 l/day, operation of POU UF system under low flux conditions is possible. One of the most important limitations for application of ultrafiltration in simple household devices, is membrane fouling. In order to overcome the reasons of the limited application of UF in POU systems, the better understanding of the UF process in these specific conditions and specially membrane fouling is needed. Recent studies have shown that dissolved or colloidal polysaccharides and proteins and their interactions with the  membrane and between macromolecules might have more severe impact. During long term dead-end filtration, accumulation of the macromolecules on the membrane surface and increase of their concentration is severe. The interactions between those macromolecules in the conditions of high concentrations in the boundary layer affect the structure of the layer and its permeability. However, in most of the studies, only the foulant-membrane interactions are considered like relevant for reversibility of fouling. The foulant-foulant interactions in the boundary layer have been studied only superficially. Therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of polysaccharide and solution properties on UF membrane fouling in conditions of low flux and limited backflushing, under constant TMP conditions (hydrostatic pressure of 120 mbar - 150 mbar. Our experimental results lead us to the following conclusions: Regarding the initial stage of flux decline (0-80 ml permeate/cm2) the polysaccharide structure, and particularly availability of carboxyl groups, has a major impact on the membrane fouling, while the molecular weights of polysaccharides does not play a significant role (in the studied range of Mw 5-250 kDa). Such solution conditions as presence of metal ions and ionic  strength are also detrimental for the fouling, while both metal ions and ionic strength have impact on the gel structure and properties, generally stabilizing it, and increasing the possibility of water trapping by hydrogen bonding, which leads to the higher permeability. However, independently of the initial solution conditions, after approx. 80 ml has been filtered through 1 cm2 of the membrane, flux becomes stable on the level of approx. 10 L/(hm2) over the whole period of operation (several weeks in some cases). We suppose that the gel layer formed by polysaccharides play a role of a “second” membrane on the surface of the PES UF membrane, keeping remaining permeability on the certain level, determined by the water retention properties of the gel structure. Regarding practical application, the obtained results open a new direction for the ultrafiltration in specific conditions of household systems. The long term ultrafiltration should be studied on natural waters to prove the flux stabilization phenomenon. This phenomenon may give a possibility to produce up to 10 L/h of water from 1 m2 of the membrane applying only 120 mbar of hydrostatic pressure (1.2 m water level difference) without backflushing or crossflow, which may simplify the design and maintenance of the system and significantly reduce its costs.  Next activities in Techneau project will include the further evaluation of the long term ultrafiltration on natural waters; characterization of the impact of biofouling on the flux decline; and evaluation of the operational parameters of the Point-of-use system, based on the proposed above concept to treat at least 20 L/day."
