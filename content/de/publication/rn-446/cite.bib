 abstract = {During periods of heavy rainfall storm sewage volumes can exceed the capacity of combined sewer systems and overflow to surface water bodies. Combined sewer overflows (CSO) cause significant impacts on the water quality and their identification is crucial to plan CSO control programs or to fulfil legal requirements. This paper proposes and demonstrates six different methods to identify the occurrence of CSO based on information on the sewer system alone (methods 1 and 2), in combination with rain data (methods 3 and 4) or in combination with water quality data of the receiving surface water (methods 5 and 6). The methods provide different information on CSO, from occurrence to pollution load and impacts in receiving surface water. The methods introduced have all been applied to the Berlin urban water system. Based on these experiences they are compared considering the effort needed for their application, the required data and the obtained output. It is concluded that certainty of CSO identification can be increased by combining some of the presented methods.},
