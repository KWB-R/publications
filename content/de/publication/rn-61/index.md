abstract = "Three single-filament isolates of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae from two German lakes were found to produce remarkable amounts of the cyanobacterial  epatotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN). CYN-synthesis of the strains were evidenced both by LC-MS/MS analysis and detection of PCR products of gene fragments which are implicated in the biosynthesis of the toxin. The strains contain CYN in the range of 2.3â€“6.6 mg gK1 of cellular dry weight. To our knowledge this is the first report of CYN in A. flos-aquae."
