abstract: "Asset management is an increasing concern for wastewater utilities and municipalities. Sewer deterioration models have been developed by research and municipalities to support the definition of cost-effective inspection and rehabilitation strategies. However, the acceptance of deterioration models among sewer operators and decision makers still raise considerable challenges. This article presents the state of the art of condition classification and sewer deterioration modeling and discusses key issues for the future development of deterioration models. Research is needed (i) to identify the most appropriate approaches for condition classification and deterioration modeling and (ii) to conclude clearly about their quality of prediction. Due to the high costs associated with CCTV inspection and data collection, the influence of input data on modeling quality and the optimal input data requirement are still to be evaluated. The ongoing project SEMA aims precisely to assess the suitability of models to simulate sewer deterioration. Objectives and strategy are shortly presented at the end of the article."
