abstract: "For a future upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Ruhleben targeting advanced removal of total phosphorus (TP) (< 50-120 µg/L TP) and seasonal disinfection, various technological options for tertiary treatment of secondary effluent are suitable to fulfill these goals. This study applies the holistic methods of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to assess and compare those options for tertiary treatment at WWTP Ruhleben in their environmental and economic impacts, including all relevant direct and indirect processes and effects of the WWTP upgrade. Options for tertiary treatment include gravity-driven processess such as dual media filtration (DMF), microsieve filtration (MSF), or high-rate sedimentation (HRS), and membrane-based processes such as ultrafiltration with polymer membranes (Polymer UF) or microfiltration with ceramic membranes (Ceramic MF). For disinfection in the summer period, gravity-driven processes are complemented by downstream UV disinfection, which is only applied in rain weather bypass for membrane processes. Process data for operational parameters and infrastructure design are based on longterm pilot trials at technical scale (DMF, MSF, Polymer UF, Ceramic MF) or process modelling based on supplier information (HRS). LCA shows that the existing phosphorus load in secondary effluent of WWTP Ruhleben (28 t/a TP) can be reduced substantially by all processes, eliminating 19-25 t/a TP (6790%) depending on the process. A minor side-benefit for effluent quality is also expected from the further elimination of heavy metals adsorbed to particulate matter in secondary effluent. At the same time, tertiary treatment schemes will increase energy demand and related emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon footprint) of the existing WWTP process by an estimated 12-21% and 7-13%, respectively. Gravity-driven processes with low coagulant dosing (DMF, MSF, HRS) have a considerably lower energy demand and carbon footprint than membrane-based processes with high electricity demand for feed pumps and higher coagulant dose. At the same time, low-energy treatment processes do not reach the exceptional high effluent quality of membrane-based processes. Consequently, a certain trade-off between energy demand/carbon footprint and effluent quality can be quantified. In analogy to the environmental assessment and effluent quality, LCC results show that total annual costs are lowest for HRS (5.1 Mio €/a) and comparable between DMF and MSF (5.7 Mio €/a), followed by Polymer UF (10.2 Mio €/a) and Ceramic MF (12.2 Mio €/a). In comparison to gravity-driven processes, membrane-based processes are characterized by both higher investment costs (factor 1.5 – 3x) and higher operational costs (factor 2 – 2.5x), mainly due to high costs of membranes, machinery, electricity, and coagulants. Comparing the relative resource efficiency for selected environmental and economic parameters related to the total load of eliminated phosphorus, DMF and MSF are the most efficient of the assessed technologies for tertiary treatment, spending ~ 250 €/kg Pelim and causing 180 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim (both with UV disinfection as post-treatment). HRS + UV has higher relative costs (270 €/kg Pelim) and higher carbon footprint (235 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim) due to the lower effluent quality of the process (= less reduction in TP loads). Membrane-based processes have the highest relative costs for P removal (400475 €/kg Pelim) and the highest carbon footprint (275 kg CO2-eq/kg Pelim): even though their superior effluent quality leads to the highest total reduction in TP loads, the high energy demand and costs of membrane processes yield higher relative spending of resources related to the final goal."
