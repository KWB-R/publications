abstract: "Due to intensive aeration in the activated sludge basins, a significant part of the organic matter in the wastewater often expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) is mineralized to the greenhouse gas CO2. Therefore the organic content in municipal wastewater is yet a widely untapped source of renewable energy. The Carismo project vision is to reduce the specific energy demand with a new treatment scheme based on a low energy microsieve separation process and at the same time, increase the specific energy recovery with an advanced separation of the organic fraction which is valorized in a digester. Therefore two treatment schemes were evaluated at lab scale and pilot scale with real wastewater. The raw wastewater contained a high COD concentration of 1000 mg/l. The first scheme treated the raw wastewater with a coagulation and flocculation step before a microsieve separation with a drum filter at 100 µm. The second scheme was similar to the first one with an additional MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) installed upstream the coagulation tank. The specific goal of the microsieve process was to increase the organic carbon extraction rate in scheme 1 to 60–80 %. The Pilot trial results showed an average COD extraction of 73–81 %. The average suspended solids (SS) removal was > 95 %. The soluble phosphorus removal was between 15 % and 70 % depending on the coagulant type and dose. With 20 mg Al/l, the effluent phosphorous concentration was around 2 mg/l. The MBBR upstream increased the COD transfer in the sludge by 3–8 %, but simultaneously the mineralization decreased the yield for the biogas process. This and the additional energy consumption of the aeration speaks against the separation process with an upstream MBBR."
