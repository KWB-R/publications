abstract: "This report compiles the results of three consecutive work packages that have been worked on during the Aquisafe II project. The approach developed is based on the previous Aquisafe I project where the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used as an analytical instrument to develop mitigation strategies for N loads and concentrations in the Ic catchment. During Aquisage I we concluded that SWAT should include a wetland function with which the effect of artificially, constructed wetlands on solute N fluxes can be evaluated. Chapter 1 compiles results of an extensive literature review that was made to identify potential wetland routines and processes that can be included in SWAT. The SWAT add-on to be developed should allow to individually test the effect on single wetlands (e.g. in a given hydrological response unit or subcatchment) as well as the effect of multiple wetlands on the landscape scale. We therefore implemented a stand alone version of the new wetland module which is described in Chapter 2. Here we show the general functionality and individual components of the wetland module. The chapter ends with a virtual application of the modules using SWAT outputs copied from the Ic results. Additionally, a Monte Carlo based sensitivity analyses of the wetland module input parameters showed that the denitrification rate seems to be the most constrained parameter for the simulation of N turnover in the new wetland module. A full implementation of the new wetland module is described in chapter 3. Here, the structural embedment of the wetland module in the SWAT architecture is described. To proof the functionality of the SWAT wetland module model runs were compared to the stand alone version to make sure that the module was correctly implemented. We conclude that the SWAT wetland extension is ready to be tested in real world catchments. Such a full test of the SWAT wetland model was planned towards the end of Aquisafe II. However, as data from the wetlands constructed within Aquisafe II were not available in due time, this last test of the SWAT module was possible."
