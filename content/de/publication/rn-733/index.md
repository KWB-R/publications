abstract: "Different types of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes are widely distributed and applied on various scales in the European countries, but no systematic categorization and compilation existed up to now. The European MAR catalogue presented herein includes a wide range of parameters, e.g. operational information, hydrogeological properties and water quality monitoring for different types of MAR. The database includes currently 270 MAR sites, but is neither a representative nor an exhaustive data compilation. Nevertheless, based on the available data it is shown that MAR plays an important role in the European water supply producing large water quantities for the domestic water supply."
