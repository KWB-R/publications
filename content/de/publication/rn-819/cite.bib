 abstract = {In recent years several ways of recovering phosphorous from municipal wastewater have been developed. Depending on the applied technology the recovered products as well as the quality of sewage sludge vary significantly concerning the concentrations of heavy metals and organic residues. Within WA 4 “environmental, economic and risk assessment of P recovery options” of the P-REX project a quantitative risk assessment of substances in phosphorus products for humans and environment is intended. In this deliverable risk assessment is done as a relative risk ranking for PCDD/F, dl-PCB, PAH, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn between seven secondary phosphate fertilizers from wastewater stream, sewage sludge, mono-incinerated ash from sewage treatment and conventional phosphorus fertilizers.},
