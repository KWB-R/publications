abstract: "This paper reports about experiences gathered from five on-line monitoring campaigns in the sewer systems of Berlin (Germany), Graz (Austria), Lyon (France) and Bogota (Colombia) using UV-VIS spectrometers and turbidimeters. The influence of local calibration on the quality of on-line COD measurements of wet weather discharges has been assessed. Results underline the need to establish local calibration functions for both UV-VIS spectrometers and turbidimeters. It is suggested to practitioners to calibrate locally their probes using at least 15-20 samples. However, these samples should be collected over several events and cover most of the natural variability of the measured concentration. For this reason, the use of automatic peristaltic samplers in parallel to on-line monitoring is recommended with short representative sampling campaigns during wet weather discharges. Using reliable calibration functions, COD loads of CSO and storm events can be estimated with a relative uncertainty of approximately 20 %. If no local calibration is established, concentrations and loads are estimated with strong errors questioning the reliability and meaning of the on-line measurement. Similar results have been obtained for TSS measurements."
