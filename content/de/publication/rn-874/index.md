abstract: "Conventional sewer models such as SWMM or InfoWorks CS are widely used to analyse effects of relative runoff reduction or storage capacity increase on a global scale. However, the applied tools are usually insufficient for planning precise stormwater management strategies on city quarter scale. We propose a modelling approach that combines a 1D sewer model and a river water quality model with a detailed hydrological rainfall-runoff model that includes model components for a multitude of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). The modelling approach is demonstrated to evaluate realistic measure combinations developed for a city quarter in Berlin, Germany. Results show that negative river impacts of combined sewer overflows (CSO), in our case fish-critical oxygen conditions, can be completely prevented with a set of adequate measures."
