abstract: "Untreated stormwater runoff can be an important source of pollutants affecting urban surface waters. To investigate the relevance of micropollutants in urban stormwater runoff for the city of Berlin, an event-based, one-year monitoring program for sampling of separate storm sewers was conducted. Monitoring points were selected in five homogeneous catchments of different urban structure types to consider catchment-specific differences. Volume proportional samples (one composite sample per event) were analysed for a comprehensive set of ~100 micropollutants determined from literature review (e.g. plasticisers [phthalates], biocides/pesticides, flame retardants [organophosphates, polybrominated diphenylethers], PAH, heavy metals) as well as standard parameters (TSS, total P, phosphate, ammonium, COD, BOD). For selected storm events, time resolved samples were analysed to investigate the concentration dynamics and evaluate first flush characteristics. Results of event mean concentrations show catchment-specific differences for the majority of detected micropollutants. Furthermore, results of time-resolved samples indicate that most parameters do not show clear first flush effects with concentrations of several micropollutants even remaining constant during the course of the storm event (e.g. mecoprop, carbendazim, TBEP)."
