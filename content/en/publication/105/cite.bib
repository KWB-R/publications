  Abstract = {The UBA’s experimental field on the outskirts of Berlin offers a unique possibility of simulating bank filtration, artificial recharge and slow sand filtration on a technical scale. The site consists of a storage reservoir (pond) with an adjacent artificial aquifer consisting of sand and gravel. Additionally the surface water can be conducted into 4 infiltration basins (two slow sand filters and two aquifer infiltration ponds). Three enclosures as well as large scale columns can be used for shorter and longer term simulation of groundwater transport. The whole site is separated from the surrounding aquifer by a layer of clay. A variety of physico-chemical parameters can be measured continuously and observed online. The travel times for the bank filtration passage determined by tracer experiments range from a few days to a maximum of 3 weeks. In the enclosures, infiltration ponds and large scale columns contact time can be varied between a few hours up to 3 months.},
