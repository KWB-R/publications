  Abstract = {Investigations on the behavior of different bulk organics and trace organic compounds at a bank filtration site at Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany, and in a long retention soil column system are reported. Objective of the research was to assess important factors of influence for the degradation of bulk and trace organics. More than two years of monitoring for the bulk parameter DOC proved that the redox conditions significantly influence the DOC-degradation kinetic but not necessarily the residual concentration. LC-OCD measurements confirmed that the change in character is comparable for aerobic and anoxic/anaerobic infiltration. Only the fraction of polysaccharides shows a better removal under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, adsorbable organic iodine (AOI) measurements revealed a more efficient degradation of AOI and AOBr under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. The monitoring of the single organic pollutants Iopromide, Sulfamethoxazole and naphthalenedisulfonic acids showed that the redox conditions have an influence on the degradation behavior of some of the monitored compounds. Iopromide was efficiently removed at all times, but no evidence for a dehalogenation under oxic conditions was found. Sulfamethoxazole showed a better removal under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. The very stable 1.5naphthalenesulfonic acid was not removed under either redox conditions.},
