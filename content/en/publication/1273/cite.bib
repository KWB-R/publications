  Abstract = {This report analyses a number of processes for material recovery at municipal wastewater treatment plants in their environmental impacts. Based on the method of Life Cycle Assessment, the analysis shows that material recovery can yield environmental benefits by reducing primary  energy demand and related greenhouse gas emissions during operation. This is mainly due to operational savings in energy, chemicals or sludge amount which come in association with material recovery. Product quality assessment for potential contamination showed no unacceptable risks for human health or ecosystems during the application and use of recovered materials.},
