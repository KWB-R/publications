  Abstract = {Proper marketing of the SMARTechs and related products or services from the EU innovation action is crucial to enable a successful commercial exploitation of the project outputs. To help the project partners and product owners with this task, the project consortium decided to develop marketing support material for each technology, service or product developed and demonstrated in the action. This report contains 13 informative flyers for marketing purposes, which support the targeted communication towards key stakeholders in this sector. The two-page flyers include information on the challenge and goal of the process, service or product together with a graphical representation, a list of unique selling points and contact information of the respective partners. The uniform design generates a high memorability and a close association to the SMART-PLANT innovation action and provides professional marketing material for the targeted end-users such as wastewater treatment plant operators and managers or other professionals in this field.},
