abstract: "The centre of Berlin, Germany, is drained by a combined sewer system. The receiving waters Havel and Spree are characterized by low flow velocities and an increased risk of eutrophication. High demands towards a reduction of the emission loads of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) down to 20 % of the mean annual runoff load of TSS, COD and BOD5 are formulated by the Berlin Water Authority. Therefore a pollution control plan will be carried out until the year 2020 that will lead to a storage enlargement of the combined sewer system by 100 %. To assess if these efforts will lead to the expected water quality of the receiving water regarding the objectives of the European Water Framework Directive, a method will be developed to evaluate in advance the achievable improvement. Starting from the actual status of the water body this model based method should allow for an estimation, if the good status will be achieved after the realization of the measures of storage upgrading in the sewer system. The study currently concentrates on the integrated water quality modelling of the high dynamic processes in the sewer system and the receiving water. The paper focuses on the simulation of oxygen concentration in the receiving water."
