abstract: "Within the project SAM-CSO it shall be tested if the Open Modelling Interface and Environment (OpenMI) can be applied to link models of the Berlin sewerage (modelled in the urban drainage software InfoWorks CS,Wallingford Software) to a river water quality model. This report gives an overview on the OpenMI and its application. Chapter 1 outlines the general background of integrated water management and integrated modelling as it is aimed at by the European Water Framework Directive. The development process, which resulted in the release of the OpenMI is summarized in chapter 2. An introduction to the objectives, the concept and the technology of the OpenMI is given in chapter 3. Chapter 4 lists case studies in which the OpenMI has been applied. In Appendix B, each of the reported studies has been described in generalized form. A matrix showing all model links, which have been established within the case studies, has been developed. Finally, in chapter 5, an overview on other model linking approaches is given. This report shows that in many use cases the Open Modelling Interface could be used successfully for model linking. Even out of Europe, at a workshop of the U.S. EPA it is stated that, in terms of the ability to go between different temporal and spatial scales, a framework such as OpenMI might have the necessary flexibility. Actually, it was found that in many cases models of the InfoWorks software family have been part of the OpenMI linked systems. In cases of many interaction points between models, the OpenMI mechanism may not be applicable. In the Berlin case the impact of combined sewer overflows on the water quality of the receiving river shall be examined. With far less than a hundred interaction points between sewer model and river model it is assumed that the OpenMI could be used for a successful model linking. The difficulty within the SAM-CSO project may be to find an apropriate river quality model, which is ready to be linked to InfoWorks CS using the OpenMI. Unfortunately, there are few use cases reported in which a freely available river water quality model was involved. The water quality model QSIM of the German Institute of Hydrology (BfG) that is used within the project is currently not equipped with OpenMI. Nevertheless, using the OpenMI mechanism for model linking is assumed to be a promising approach. It is expected to become an internationally accepted standard. As the OpenMI specification is fully free, anyone may contribute to its further development. The OpenMI Association will give advice to modellers and will be open to discussions on improvement of the OpenMI. With the OpenMI linking mechanism not only models can be linked. Modules for calibration, optimization, statistical evaluation etc. can be part of an OpenMI system as well as components for generic data access or visualization. It will be tested, if the integration of such a module for statistical evaluation into the CSO impact assessment method (to be developed within the project SAM-CSO) is applicable and useful."
