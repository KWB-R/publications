  Abstract = {In recent years considerable progress has been made in numerical weather prognosis. Special progress has been made in doing local forecasts up to five days of temperature, wind and atmospheric pressure and al so o f the weather det erminant flow s ystems. In contrast, the local prognosis of precipitation (liquid and ice phase) has not been improved. T his circumstance has lead to the DFG p rogram “Quantitative rainfall prognosis”. I t co vers broadly base d activities that ai m on the i mprovement o f t he knowledge on t he pr ocesses of r ainfall f ormation and t heir num erical pr ognosis. The main objective is to improve the routine prognosis of the German Weather Association (DWD). The program covers the modeling of microphysical processes as well as the description of essential meteorological conditions in different temporal and spatial scales. Especially, co nvective c loud sy stems that ar e often responsible for e xtreme r ainfall situations are studied. In a G ermany-wide monitoring campaign in the year 2007 comprehensive measurements are conducted. The gained information and data will be used to improve process description and to support model evaluation. The st udy at hand describes the anal ysis and pr ognosis of temporally (5 m in) and spatially (500 m) highly distributed rainfall data for the Berlin area. The data will be used in the frame of the EVA project of Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin to analyse and evaluate the potential of online rainfall measurement and forecast to support the operation of wastewater pump stations.},
