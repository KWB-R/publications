abstract: "The widespread application of the membrane-assisted activated sludge process is restricted by membrane fouling, which increases investment and operating costs. Soluble microbial products (SMPs) are currently considered as the major cause of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study aims at elucidating and quantifying the effects of varying environmental conditions on SMP elimination and rejection based on findings in a pilot MBR and in well-defined lab trials. Several factors are thought to influence the concentration ofSMP and their fouling propensity in one way or the other, but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Here, SMP loading rate was found to have the greatest effect on SMP elimination and thus on concentration in the MBR. The degree of elimination decreased at very lowDO and low nitrate concentrations. On average, 75% of influent SMP were eliminated in both pilot and lab trials, with the elimination of polysaccharides (PS) mostly above 80%. Rejection of SMP components by the used membrane (PAN, 37nm) ranged mainly from 20% to 70% for proteins and from 75% to 100% for PS. Especially protein rejection decreased at higher temperatures and higher nitrification activity. The increased fouling rates at lower temperatures might therefore partly be explained by this increased rejection. Apparently, mainly the nitrite-oxidising community is responsible for the formation for smaller SMP molecules that can pass the membrane."
