 abstract = {Since the 1970s, we have known about real-time control of urban drainage systems. However, global real-time control strategies still show a lack of implementation for large drainage systems of high complexity. In Berlin, Germany, a city of 3.5 million inhabitants covering an area of around 900 km2, the demand for enhanced protection of the environment and growing economic pressure have led to an increasing application of control assets and concepts within the sewage system. In the framework of the project "Integrated Sewage Management", the possibilities of a global and integrated control strategy for the Berlin system are examined. The paper is focused on the historical concept and design of the sewerage and the further improvement towards an environment-oriented system that builds the basis for today's considerations. The operational method and functionality of local regulators that have already been implemented are described. Further-more, the model-based methodology for the analysis of the system and the development of global control concepts, as well as the results of system analysis, are stated. On the basis of model simulations, it is shown that a global coordination of pump stations can lead to a reduction of sewer overflows, and consequently to an enhanced water protection.},
