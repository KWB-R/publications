abstract: "The Berlin Centre of Competence for Water organised, together with the International Water Association, the 2nd National Young Water Professionals Conference in Germany. This event was held on 4-5 June 2007 in Berlin and was following up on the first NYWP conference organised in Aachen in October 2005. It provided a forum for young researchers and professionals working in the membrane sector of the wastewater industry to present their work and meet their peers. The conference consisted on formal presentation of papers and posters, and an exchange with water industry professionals providing information on water career opportunities in Germany. This event was an initiative of “MBR-Network”, the European cluster on the membrane bioreactor technology, gathering about 50 European and international companies and institutions within the four FP6 projects Amedeus, Eurombra, MBR-Train and Puratreat (more info at www.mbrnetwork.eu). The technical program of the conference consisted mainly of contributions from German and international young water professionals including students, recent graduates and other professionals under the age of 35. This book contains most of the papers and posters which were presented at the Conference."
