 abstract = {This report presented recent developments in the field on the UV-LED disinfection. This technological field is very recent and further interests - along with rapid and continuing improvements in performance (especially in terms of emission power) - are expected within the next years. After the physical characterisation of the few UV-LEDs - at 269 and 282 nm - that are currently available on the market, their disinfecting action was to be measured via biodosimetric tests. They show an increase of the inactivationwith an increasing fluence using different types of raw water, although some early static tests tend to highlight potential recontamination and inhomogeneous distribution of UV-light - which may be explained by the module configuration. Main other results indicate that UV-absorbing compounds in the various waters reduce the disinfection capacity. Morevoer, a more effective disinfection is observed at 269 nm than at 282 nm for a similar fluence. However, the emission output is better with 282 nm - UV-LEDs. Therefore, an interesting aspect, worth being investigated in the future is to ensure an optimized configuration, which balances the input power, which is necessay to run the UV-LED module, and its disinfecting action. With potential enhanced emission powers, new developments for UV-LED water purification applications would enable to perform larger-scale tests and shorten UV exposure times.},
