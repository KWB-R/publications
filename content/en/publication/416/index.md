abstract: "Bank filtration, i.e. the abstraction of groundwater from wells along a river or lake, thus inducing infiltration has a long history as (pre-) treatment step for drinking water production in Europe. The goal of this study is to assess whether groundwater waterworks using BF have a cost advantage compared to SWTPs if both, water abstraction and treatment processes are considered."
