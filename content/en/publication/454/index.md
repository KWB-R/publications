abstract: "In the 2nd phase of the project (OXIRED 2), trials at lab and technical scale were conducted to validate the results for trace organic and DOC removal from OXIRED 1 and to gain a more reliable knowledge about oxidation by-product formation for surface water from Berlin. To assess the stability of the process, a pilot unit was operated at Lake Tegel. Moreover the effect of oxidation + MAR on toxicological parameters was investigated (s. D 1.1). To prepare a field study three sites in Germany were evaluated regarding their suitability including parameters such as aquifer depth and composition, source water quality and possibility of authorization (s. D 2.1). The results were that none of the sites (Hobrechtsfelde, Braunschweig WWTP or artificial recharge site in Görlitz) was identified as suitable. The current state-of-the-art for influencing the redox zonation in the subsurface was reviewed (D 3.1) and the options to assess the quantity, composition and activity of the microbial population in the soil samples were summarized (D 2.2). To investigate the dynamic of redox processes, short term column tests were conducted (D 3.2). On the basis of these results reactive flow and transport modelling was carried out (D 3.2 and 3.3). The aim of this report is to give a summary of the main results from OXIRED 2 and to identify promising opportunities for further experiments and transfer to field scale."
