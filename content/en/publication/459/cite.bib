 abstract = {It was the aim of the EU funded research project TECHNEAU to investigate the relevance and feasibility of bank filtration (BF) plus post-treatment for newly industrialised and developing countries. Field studies at BF sites in Delhi (India) were supplemented by literature studies and modelling in order to investigate if this natural drinking water (pre-) treatment is a sustainable option to provide safe drinking water for countries like India. The results showed that especially for those substances that are of relevance in newly industrialised and developing countries subsurface passage can represent an efficient barrier. However, certain limiting factors for BF application also need to be considered: high ammonium levels in surface water, usually associated with high shares of poorly or un-treated sewage, will not be mitigated during subsurface passage and require extensive post-treatment. In order to support decision makers in the difficult task of assessing the feasibility of BF systems at a certain site a simple decision support system was developed. This simple tool enables to assess a range of abstraction rates and well locations for a specific field site that could fit with their needs (e.g. minimum required travel time or share of BF).},
