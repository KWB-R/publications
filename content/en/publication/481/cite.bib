  Abstract = {In the course of identifying areas of relevance for further research and development the members of the European Water Supply and Sanitation Technology (WssTP) identified Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) as an important cross-cutting topic and area relevant for further research. For this reason a Task Force on MAR was initiated with 36 representatives from European research institutes and industry partners with participation of international experts. These task force members developed the basis for a report documenting the state of the art and research needs in the field of MAR that has now been published by the WssTP.},
