abstract: "This work was carried out within the framework of the project OPTIWELLS at the Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB), a non-profit network society for water research and science transfer. The project addresses the modelling of a well field in order to minimise its energy demand. The first phase of the project is a feasibility study to identify the optimization possibilities of the energy demand. The first part of the study concerns the design and testing of a hydraulic model. At the beginning it was implemented on MS Excel and after with the help of Epanet, an opensource software. Data from the operator and manufacturers as well as measured data, gained during a site audit, were used to calibrate the model. Goals were to understand how the well field was working and to identify the energy demand drivers. The second part of the study concerned the choice and the implementation of scenarios with different operational conditions for the well field. Scenarios were focused on two aspects: the change of boundary conditions and the study of possible investments. A cost comparative assessment was carried out to estimate the payback times of the investigated scenarios. Results and according recommendations were communicated to the well field manager."
