  Abstract = {Recent infrastructure studies underline the general deterioration of sewer systems and the risk reversing public health, environment and increasing costs (ASCE, 2009). Aging pipes have not been inspected, replaced or rehabilitated rapidly enough to prevent sewer deterioration and increasing system failures (Tuccillo et al., 2010). According to a need survey conducted by EPA (2008), total funding needs for replacement, rehabilitation and expansion of existing collection systems for a 20 year period in the USA is 82.7 billions $, i.e. 28% of the total need of public agencies for wastewater treatment and collection. In the last 30 years, most municipalities have invested in sewer system expansion and treatment plant upgrade but a relatively small component has been allocated to the improvement of sewer system condition.},
