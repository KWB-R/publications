  Abstract = {To cope with occurring traces of organic contaminants in the effluent of waste water treatment plants, ozonation is a suitable technical treatment method. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the necessity of a posttreatment of ozonation effluents to remove possible toxic ozonation by-products. This study compares a dual media filter (DMF) and a biological activated carbon filter (BAC), which were used for ozonation post-treatment, and were also designed as coagulation filters for tertiary phosphor removal. The results of this study demonstrate that both rapid filters performed similarly in respect to DOC reduction and oxygen demand, and could also be used for tertiary phosphorus removal without any impairments. A comparison of a serial mode of the DMF and the BAC with a slow sand filter, which was used as a surrogate for an infiltration pond, showed that this two-stage process could increase the degradation of the DOC, but was not able to remove the entire biodegradable DOC.},
