abstract: "Risk-based management approaches are more and more used in the water sector and are promoted by the WHO. As a first step towards an overall risk-based management approach of the agricultural wastewater reuse concept of Braunschweig a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is conducted. A 1000 trial Monte Carlo Simulation is used for the assessment of microbial risks for fieldworkers and nearby residents. As a tolerable value of risk an additional disease burden of 1 ÂµDALY is set following the current WHO guidelines. Concerning microbial risks risk-based targets are set in terms of additional required pathogen reduction in the STP Steinhof. Based on the model results an additional reduction of 1.5log units is derived for viruses, for which the highest annual risks of infection per person per year (pppy) is calculated in all scenarios."
