abstract: "The present study provides an overview of geogenic contamination, its occurrence, impacts and possible treatment options for drinking water production. Natural background and anthropogenic contamination can be differentiated using an algorithm based on the frequency distribution of measured substance concentrations. Case studies for geogenic contaminants such as ammonium, fl uoride, chloride, sulfate and uranium are discussed based on the origin, occurrence, controlling factors and treatment options. It is suggested that, in case of occurrence of geogenic contaminants, water must be treated or alternative sources need to be found, e.g., managed aquifer recharge, prior to the distribution as drinking water."
