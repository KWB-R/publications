  Abstract = {We investigate water quality of a small urban river during dry and wet weather conditions, including both standard parameters and trace organics. The monitored river stretch receives both effluents from WWTP as well as (separate) stormwater runoff of an impervious area of 11 km2. Results show increases in concentrations in the river during rain events with a factor > 20 for zinc, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, two herbicides and one flame retardant. Also, substances which are expected both in WWTP effluent and in stormwater effluents were detected at important concentrations in the river during wet weather, such as the corrosion inhibitor Benzotriazole (0.8 µg/L on average) and the plasticizer Diisodecyl phthalate (4.0 µg/L on average). The presented results are preliminary and will be complemented by more results and substances as well as an assessment of the relevance of the findings.},
