  Abstract = {This report provides the reader with an overview of assessment methodologies used within DEMOWARE and the specific features when using QMRA, QCRA, LCA, and WFP approach for the assessment of water reuse systems. For the actual application of LCA and water footprint databases and assessment software is needed. Therefore, three complementing goals shall be achieved: (i) to provide practitioners with the principles, methods and limitations of QMRA, QCRA, LCA and WFP (ii) to provide LCA, WFP, RA practitioners with additional information when using the respective method for the assessment of water reuse systems. For QMRA a summary of guidelines and default values is collected from different guidelines documents (WHO, Australia, US-EPA), which allow a first simplified and thus user friendly risk estimate.},
