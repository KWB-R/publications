  Title = {Quantifying biogeochemical changes during ASR of reclaimed water at Bolivar, South Australia},
  Volume = {13},

  Abstract = {A modelling study was carried out to provide a process-based quantitative interpretation of the biogeochemical changes that were observed during an ASR experiment in which reclaimed water was injected into a limestone aquifer at a field-site near Bolivar, South Australia. A site-specific conceptual model for the interacting hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes that occur during reclaimed water ASR was developed and incorporated into an existing reactive multi-component transport model. The major reactive processes considered in the model were microbially mediated redox reactions, driven by the mineralisation of organic carbon, mineral precipitation/ dissolution and ion exchange. The study showed that the geochemical changes observed in the vicinity of the ASR well could only be adequately described by a model that explicitly considers microbial growth and decay processes, while an alternative, simpler model formulation based on the assumption of steady state biomass concentration failed to reproduce the observed hydrochemical changes. However, both, the simpler and the more complex model approach were able to reproduce the geochemical changes further away from the injection/extraction well. These changes were  interpretated as a  result of the combined effect of ion exchange, calcite dissolution and mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon.},
