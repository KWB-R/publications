  Abstract = {Within Work Area 5 of the DEMEAU project, selected innovative technologies and tools for emerging contaminants removal and monitoring are assessed in their environmental and economic benefits and impacts by using life-cycle based tools such as environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and economic Life Cycle Costing (LCC). Six case studies were assessed to quantify their environmental and economic profiles and formulate unique selling propositions to promote market uptake and implementation. These case studies include managed aquifer recharge for groundwater replenishment or for drinking water production in combination with advanced oxidation process, hybrid ceramic membrane filtration with powdered activated carbon for tertiary wastewater treatment, automatic neural net control systems to optimize membrane operation, ozonation of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and bioassays as screening tool for water quality monitoring. This report summarizes the study layout, input data, and results of LCA and LCC for all case studies and indicates unique selling propositions based on the outcomes of the assessment.},
