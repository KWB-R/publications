  Title = {Impacts of suspended solids, water temperature and dilution on TrOC elimination and UVA254 reduction by laboratory scale ozonation of secondary effluent},
  Year = {2016},
  Abstract = {Ozonation is known as a suitable technical process to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOC) in secondary effluent. To decide if ozonation is a suitable option as an upgrade of a specific wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), ozonation experiments in laboratory-scale can help to avoid the operation of expensive and labour intensive pilot plants. Such laboratory experiments should be conducted at similar conditions and by the same methods in order to achieve a better comparability of the results. In this study, potential impacts of sample dilution due to the addition of an ozone stock solution, water temperature, and concentration of suspended solids (TSS) on TrOC elimination and UVA254 reduction (delta UVA254) were investigated. The results show that a change in water temperature within a range of 10 to 30Â°C and sample dilution of less than 20% due to the addition of ozone stock solution at batch ozonation, respectively, does neither have a significant impact on achieved TrOC elimination nor or delta UVA254. Suspended solids affected the TrOC elimination and delta UVA254 at TSS concentrations of more than 30 mg/L, whereas at low TSS concentrations (< 4 mg/L), the impact of TSS was found to be neglectable.},
