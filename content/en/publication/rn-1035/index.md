abstract: "This report describes different options for tertiary treatment of secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants for the purpose of water reuse. For each of the treatment trains, associated environmental impact (represented by energy demand and related global warming potential) and risk reduction potential (i.e. removal of chemical and microbial contaminants) are described based on the results of the DEMOWARE case studies. This should inform water professionals about impacts and benefits of different options for producing reclaimed water, enabling an informed decision on an adequate treatment train depending on the water quality targets for the respective reuse purpose."
