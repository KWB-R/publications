abstract: "Investigations on the behaviour of different trace organic compounds at a bank filtration site at Lake Wannsee in the city of Berlin, Germany are reported. More than two years of monitoring for the bulk parameter differentiated adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) revealed a more efficient degradation of adsorbable organic iodine (AOI) and adsorbable organic bromine (AOBr) under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. 64% of AOI were removed under reducing condition, whereas under oxic conditions only ~35% were dehalogenated. One year of monitoring of the single organic pollutants Iopromide (X-ray contrast agent), Sulfamethoxazole (bacteriostatica) and naphthalenesulfonic acid (industrial chemical) showed that the redox conditions have a strong influence on the degradation behaviour of some of the monitored compounds. Iopromide was efficiently removed under oxic conditions, but no evidence for a dehalogenation under oxic conditions was found. Sulfamethoxazole showed a better removal under anoxic/anaerobic conditions (97% in 0.5 month retention time). Oxic infiltration only led to a removal of 62%, even with longer retention times of 2.8 months. The very stable 1.5-naphthalenesulfonic acid was not removed under either redox conditions."
