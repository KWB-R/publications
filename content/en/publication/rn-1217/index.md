abstract: "The wash out of agricultural auxiliary chemicals like fertilizer and pesticides via surface run-off or subsurface leaching into drainage systems or ground waters, which discharge into surface waters, presents an increasing risk for drinking water production and biodiversity in rivers and lakes. Mitigation zones are important measures to attenuate contamination at the source and relieve surface waters downstream. Under high flow conditions, as they occur during rainy seasons and snow melt, the effectiveness of such facilities is restricted due to bypass of untreated waters or very short contact times. This study of the Aquisafe 2 project focus on drainage water decontamination and examines mitigation zone designs with organic substrates for their potential to reduce a set of herbicides and nitrate (NO3-), concurrently and efficiently, at short hydraulic residence times (0.2 to 2.5 days) to prepare their implementation in contamination hot spots. The herbicides bentazone, atrazine and isoproturon were classified as most relevant for drinking water production. On the basis of comprehensive literature studies the organic substrates bark mulch and straw and the design of bioretention swales emerged to be of high potential for decontamination of drainage waters in mitigation zones. In laboratory scale studies the substrates were tested in degradation-, sorption- and leaching-experiments at temperatures around 21 Â°C for their potential to ensure long- lasting hydraulic permeability, denitrification and attenuation of the selected herbicides. The selected organic substrates provide a high and long term stable permeable conductivity to realize and maintain high flow. The effective porosity yielded around 0.45 and reduced within 1.5 years by only 25 %. Straw is a readily available organic carbon source, which can support effective and efficient denitrification at short hydraulic residence times. Bark mulch contains more resistant carbon species, but contributes also to NO3- removal. In mixture with straw the performance of bark mulch as organic carbon source for denitrification increases (co-metabolic decomposition). Organic substrates are characterized by strong wash out of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and high denitrification rates (15 to 45 g-N m-3 d-1) in the start phase and successive decrease of denitrification performance due to loss of readily available organic carbon. Despite decline of performance, denitrification rates stabilized after one year of operation at constant conditions at a level of 4 to 10 g-N m-3 d-1 (10 to 25 % of input). The potential of the organic substrate to retain the selected herbicides is very different for each compound and bases on different dissipation paths. Denitrifying conditions are in general disadvantageous for retention of the selected herbicides. Bentazone is too persistent and mobile to be considerably retained under high flow conditions. Atrazine can be substantially removed from drainage waters. It is suspected to be attenuated predominantly by formation of bound residues at the organic substrate, especially bark mulch, and partially by degradation to hydroxy-atrazine. Isoproturon seems to be effectively retained under suboxic conditions by degradation to metabolites. At technical scale parallel retention of NO3- and atrazine and NO3- and isoproturon was investigated. The potential of the organic carbon source (mixture of bark mulch and"
