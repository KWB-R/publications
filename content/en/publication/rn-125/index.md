abstract: "The aim of the study was to calculate mixing proportions of treated wastewater in the surface water and production wells during bank filtration as well as the travel times to observation and abstraction wells. For this purpose, a variety of tracers such as the stable isotopes deuterium (D) and 18O and several wastewater indicators like chloride, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), boron and the rare earth element (REE) gadolinium (Gd) are used and compared to each other. Time series measurements in the surface water could be traced back in bank filtrates and raw water. Gd-DTPA was found to be a useful sewage indicator, even though it is biodegradable at favourable conditions at very slow rates. The travel times of the bank filtrates were obtained by the analysis of the peak shift in time-series of the tracer. Most tracers were found to be applicable but best results were obtained with the stable isotopes."
