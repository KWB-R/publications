 abstract = {The use of numerical models has become state of the art in planning, designing and analysing the urban sewage system. To evaluate the functioning of a complete system and to study the interaction of its subsystems integrated models can be used, incorporating catchment area, collection system, wastewater treatment plant and also receiving water and groundwater body. The paper introduces a structured, problem-oriented methodology for the setup of integrated models. Considering the case study of Berlin the introduced approach is illustrated. An emphasis is placed on the necessity for the selection of adequate model components. In Berlin this aspect is of particular importance for the modelling of wastewater transport through pressure mains that is governed predominantly by pump stations. Finally, the use of the Berlin model for the evaluation of a global pump station control concept is presented. It can be shown that besides the possibility of total system analysis and evaluation a major benefit from integrated modelling is the consideration of the interaction of the systemâ€™s subcomponents.},
