abstract: "Tropical cyanobacteria in German waters: Causes and consequences - Toxic cyanobacteria of tropical origin have spread to water bodies in northern Germany. Here their population size is determined by the onset of germination: the earlier the time of germination, the larger the summer population. Climate-related early increase in water temperatures over the course of the years has promoted their spreading to temperate regions. Toxins known from these species in tropical regions were also found in German lakes. Surprisingly, these toxins are not produced by the invaders but by native species. Thus, the invasion have drawn our attention to an old problem. However, the invaders itself potentially also poses a health risk in German lakes since they produce other – so far unidentified – toxic substances."
