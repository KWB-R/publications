abstract: "A continuous monitoring, using UV-VIS spectrometers, was carried out in Berlin from 2010 to 2012. It combined (i) continuous measurements of the quality and flow rates of combined sewer overflows (CSO) at one main CSO outlet downstream of the overflow structure and (ii) continuous measurements of water quality parameters at five sites within the urban stretch of the receiving River Spree. Locally, the collection of data aims at (i) characterizing CSO emissions, (ii) assessing the local dynamics and intensity of CSO impacts on the river and (iii) calibrating sewer and river water quality models being part of a planning tool for future CSO management in Berlin (Riechel et al., 2011). UV-VIS spectrometers are in-situ probes, which measure absorbance spectra ranging from UV to visual wavelengths. Concentrations, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), are calculated from these spectra. Due to the varying composition of waste and river water a local calibration is required to enhance the measurement quality. According to Gamerith et al. (2011), manufacturer global calibration can lead to systematic error up to 50% for COD measurements."
