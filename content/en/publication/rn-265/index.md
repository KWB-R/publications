abstract: "MBR-technology is able to fulfil similar or even higher standard for nutrients removal than conventional activated sludge processes. This paper presents the optimisation of the membrane bioreactor technology, together with a low pressure sewer, to equip a remote and yet unsewered area of Berlin requiring high quality wastewater treatment. The hydraulic flow pattern of the entire system has to be studied carefully due to the small collection system (no time delay between wastewater discharge and treatment to minimise the daily profile). The pollutant concentrations in the wastewater exhibit also stronger variations. In order to flatten out the hydraulic and load profile, and therefore to reduce the size of the biological reactor and the membrane surface, an buffer tank was installed before the MBR-plant. A full analysis of the influent hydraulic flow and wastewater characterisation is provided for the demonstration MBR-plant."
