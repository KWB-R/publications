abstract: "Two membrane bioreactor (MBR) plants were operated with a process which combines enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and post-denitrification without external carbon dosing in the anoxic zone. An enhanced post-denitrification with denitrification rates (DNR) twice as high as the expected endogenous rate was observed. Batch tests revealed a linear correlation between the anaerobic acetate loading and the postDNR which is remarkable since the aerobic phase was located in-between the anaerobic and anoxic phase. An anaerobic build up of a carbon storage compound which can outlast the aerobic phase is postulated. Measurements showed that neither polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) nor glycogen are used as carbon source for the enhanced post-denitrification. A carbon mass balance in the anaerobic phase strongly indicates the formation of a different so far unknown storage compound. This assumption is supported by literature data which show carbon recovery ratios of known storage compounds (PHAs and glycogen) in the anaerobic phase of EBPR systems often below 1 down to 0.3, in particular for trials performed with real wastewater. The potential of enhanced post-denitrification in conventional UCT systems is also demonstrated in full-scale non-MBR wastewater plants. When implemented in MBR process, enhanced nutrients elimination could be biologically achieved with 99% TP-removal and 90% TN-removal. A small full-scale unit is in operation in Berlin since March 2006 to demonstrate the process in real operation conditions with domestic wastewater."
