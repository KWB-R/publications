abstract: "The sewer system of the city shows predominantly low gradients and partly high inline sewer capacities. A historically founded system of 63 pump stations is used for the delivery and distribution of combined water and wastewater from the collection systems via long force mains to six wwtps. Simultaneously, in case of rainfall events the pumps act as variable throttles on the outflow of the combined sewerage and activate the inline sewer capacities. High demands are formulated by the water authority to the emissions out of the waste water system into the sensible water bodies. Five of six wwtps of the city are situated in the surrounding area of Berlin. Due to the long distances between the pump stations in the inner city and the wwtps, the time until the dilution effect of the stormwater will be noticed at the inlet of the wwtp may last several hours. Due to the increased delivery rate at the pump stations of the combined sewer system during stormwater runoff (twice the dry weather peak flow), the pollution load at the wwtp increases immediately in the same amount. Due to the enlargement of storage within the combined sewer systems until the year 2020 to meet higher demands of the water authority, the total duration of a raised inflow to the wwtp during and after rain events will increase. To furthermore keep the processes at the wwtp stable (especially the nitrogen removal) the construction of a storage tank at the inlet of the wwtp (=outlet of the pressure main) as an option shall be taken under research. The volume of the storage tank is not only determined by the quantity but also by the quality of the inflow  To provide evidence, that the new version of InfoWorks 9.5 CS® is able to calculate the flow and pollution processes in the pressure main network, a diploma thesis is carried out at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water with the participation of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe"
