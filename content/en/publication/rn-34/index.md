abstract: "The Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin) together with its partners Berliner Wasserbetriebe and Veolia Water has started a pilot project about new sanitation concepts. In order to define the experiments for testing new, sustainable sanitation concepts a pre-study has been performed. This study included a cost comparison between two new sanitation concepts with gravity and vacuum separation toilets and the conventional system. It could be demonstrated that the new sanitation concepts may have cost advantages depending on the situation. This was a further motivation starting a pilot project near Berlin testing the above mentioned toilet systems under realistic conditions. The operation of the gravity separation toilets concept started in October 2003."
