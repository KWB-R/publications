abstract: "The neurotoxin anatoxin-a (ATX), has been detected in several northeast German lakes during the last two decades, but no ATX producers have been identified in German water bodies so far. In 2007 and 2008, we analyzed phytoplankton composition and ATX concentration in Lake  tolpsee (NE Germany) in order to identify ATX producers. Sixty-one Aphanizomenon spp. strains were isolated, morphologically and phylogenetically characterized, and tested for ATX production potential by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). New primers were specifically designed to identify a fragment of a polyketide synthase gene putatively involved in ATX synthesis and tested on all 61 Aphanizomenon spp. strains from L. Stolpsee and 92 non-ATX-producing Aphanizomenon spp., Anabaena spp. and Anabaenopsis spp. strains from German lakes Langersee, Melangsee and Scharmützelsee. As demonstrated by LC–MS/MS, ATX concentrations in L. Stolpsee were undetectable in 2007 and ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 µg l-1 in 2008. Fifty-nine of the 61 strains isolated were classified as Aphanizomenon gracile and two as Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi. One A. issatschenkoi strain was found to produce ATX at concentrations of 2354 ± 273 µg g-1 fresh weight, whereas the other A. issatschenkoi strain and A. gracile strains tested negative. The polyketide synthase gene putatively involved in ATX biosynthesis was found in the ATX-producing A. issatschenkoi strain from L. Stolpsee but not in the non-ATX-producing Aphanizomenon spp., Anabaena spp. and Anabaenopsis spp. strains from lakes Stolpsee, Langersee, Melangsee, and Scharmützelsee. This study is the first confirming A. issatschenkoi as an ATX producer in German water bodies."
