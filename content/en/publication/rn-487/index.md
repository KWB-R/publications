abstract: "As a part of well field optimization the pump, as a key component in water extraction systems and its energy saving potentials have to be checked. In addition to the project deliverable D2.1 “Literature review on theoretical pump and motor efficiency of submersible pump systems” the availability of innovative and energy saving submersible pumps on the market has to be verified. Therefore, the market has been scanned and evaluated. The purpose of this document is to present the results of the market analysis for efficient pumps and to assess realistic energy saving potentials that are achievable with today’s technology. This achievement can be reached by either selecting more efficient centrifugal pumps or motors (evaluated in this study), or by considering some boundary conditions such as losses in power supply cables, operating mode or the use of variable speed drives. These accompanying conditions were also discussed at the workshop and are presented as a short summary in the last chapter of this paper."
