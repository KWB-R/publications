 abstract = {Water is one of the sectors where climate change will be most pronounced, but at the same time it is one of the sectors where numerous adaptation possibilities exist. While the extents of the impacts are not known yet, it is the right period to prepare the utilities to adapt to the global changes in an urbanizing world. Adaptation to climate change, though not always perceived as such, is already reality in the urban water sector. In this context, within the framework of the international research project PREPARED funded by the European Commission and, among others, Veolia Water and local utilities, a toolbox consisting in a catalogue and a dynamic matrix of initiatives in the water sector is being compiled by the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water, KWB.},
