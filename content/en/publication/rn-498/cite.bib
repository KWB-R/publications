 abstract = {The optimisation of drinking water well field operation may significantly reduce the energy demand and associated costs, but is seldom applied in a systematic methodological approach. In this study, a well field was analysed using a coupled model that takes into account aquifer, wells, pumps and raw water pipes. This coupled approach enabled to identify and quantify the key energy demand drivers. The geometrical elevation was the most important driver, while pipe network losses were in the same order of magnitude as aquifer- and well losses. Using the modelling tool, the most energyefficient well field operation scheme could be derived and energy savings of up to 17% may be achieved by optimising well field operation only whereas further 5% may be saved by investing in new pump equipment. These findings show the potentials for significant energy savings in the field of drinking water abstraction.},
