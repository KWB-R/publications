abstract: "As part of the EU-Life ENREM demonstration project the Department of Chemical Engineering, TU Berlin, was appointed to conduct the preliminary pilot trials in a representative site for verification of basic process designs and operation criteria of the full-scale MBR demonstration plant. In addition to conception and construction of the pilot plant, this investigation consists of two successive trial phases with distinct operation conditions: the first one being dedicated to the assessment of the “irregular sludge wastage strategy” (the biomass is accumulating in the reactor, which is partly emptied when the sludge concentration reaches a given value), and the second one being planned to verify normal operation conditions with daily sludge wastage. This progress report describes implementation and results of the first phase, for which a pilot plant of 140L was operated over 6 months with waste water of a decentralized area. The influent contained high concentrations of nitrogen (100-200 mg/L), phosphorus (10- 20 mg/l) and COD (1000-2000 mg/L). Also surprising were the high VFA concentrations (100-300 mg/L) which ensured a good EBPR process.  The COD and also the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) were not impacted by the irregular sludge wastage. COD effluent concentrations were around 50 mg/L and TP effluent was 0.1 to 0.3 mg/L.  The high nitrogen influent concentrations were problematic. Due to changing TS concentrations and changing nitrification rates TN effluent was 10 to 30 mg/L with a NH4-N content of 0 to 20 mg/L. Denitrification rates were measured between 1 and 3 mgN/gVS h and were depending on TS concentration, with higher rates at lower TS concentrations. Polysaccharide concentrations in the sludge water phase were higher with low TS concentrations and low oxygen concentrations. Higher PS values led to faster fouling. Results of the trials suggest that the oxygen concentration should be kept above 2mg/L to ensure both sufficient nitrification and lower fouling. Since also high TS concentrations are needed to ensure complete nutrients removal the optimum TS range is relatively small and it must be concluded that the irregular sludge wastage strategy was not beneficial in this case and the demonstration plant should be run with regular sludge removal."
