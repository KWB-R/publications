abstract: "According to the European Water Framework Directive, ‘good ecological and chemical status’ must  be achieved for all surface waters by 2015 (European Parliament, 2000). Therefore, it is important to  extend knowledge on pollutants that run off with urban rainwater. This study has the objective to  determine which micropollutants occur in Berlin’s urban rain water run-off and how the most  detrimental pollutants can be managed in a sustainable manner to reduce their impact on receiving  waters.  To reach these objectives, five catchments with different land use characteristics that together  represent Berlin were selected for the collection of rainwater samples. These catchments consisted  of New buildings (New), Old buildings (Old), One family homes (Ofh), Commercial buildings (Com)  and Streets (Str). Actual sampling was done by installing an automated water sampler at each  location, together with a flow measuring device to start the sampler during rain events.  The following number of rain events were sampled and analysed; New (n=8), Old (n=7), Ofh (n=6),  Com (n=11) and Str (n=4). Samples collected during rain events were processed to one volume  proportional composite sample that represents the entire event. This sample was then analysed on  the presence and concentration of micropollutants. With that information, measures where  determined that can be applied for the reduction of pollutant loads.  Micropollutants from the following groups were found during this study; pesticides / biocides,  industrial chemicals, PAH’s, heavy metals, tracers, flame retardants and phthalates.  From these groups, the most detrimental are; Nickel, Diuron, Isoproturon, Cadmium, Lead, PFOA,  PFOS , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), Nonylphenol, DEHP, Zinc, Copper, TCPP, Mecoprop,  Glyphosphat, OHBT and Di-iso-decylphthalat.  To assess measures for micropollutant reduction, the concept of source-path-threatened object was  used to identify where pollutants come from and what pathway they follow to which vulnerable  objects. Possible measures to reduce the load of these substances are banning or substituting the  pollutant by legislation. Furthermore, vegetation infrastructure, decentralized pre-treatment,  infiltration and sedimentation can be applied for reduction of pollutant loads. These measures  should be applied in an integrated manner to enhance one another.  Pollutant characteristics -and thus behaviour in the environment- is one of the most relevant criteria  for the selection of measures to reduce these substances. The most effective approaches for particle  and non-particle bound pollutants are end-of-pipe solutions. These consist of sedimentation systems  for particle bound, and infiltration structures for non-particle bound micropollutants. Emitting  sources (e.g. traffic) and paths (e.g. air) that contribute to pollutants in urban rainwater run-off are  further relevant criteria. These can only be directly reduced by legislation, vegetation infrastructure  can however be applied to reduce the mobility of these pollutants."
