abstract: "The final report of the project COSMA describes the modeling results of four different scenarios regarding the pressure build-up in shallow aquifers due to the injection of CO2 into the sandstone aquifers of the Detfurth Formation. It is based on the “Technical Report on hydrogeological and static structural geological model implementation” (D 2.1) which focuses on the compilation of geological and hydrogeological background data (average values) and the development of a simplified conceptual hydrogeological model for a setting typical for the Northern German Sedimentary Basin as well as the model selection, model parameterization, definition of boundary conditions and implementation in hydrogeological flow model software packages. The hydrogeological model of the Cenozoic includes Quaternary and Tertiary aquifers down to the layer beneath the Rupelian clay. Moreover, a concept for modeling the interaction between deep, consolidated, saline aquifers with unconsolidated freshwater aquifers was developed. This report describes scenario analyses by using the numerical hydraulic model of the Detfurth Formation (Middle Bunter) and the simplified numerical groundwater model of the Cenozoic. The numerical models can be used to assess the key parameters, having an impact on the upconing of deeper saline groundwater beneath the well fields of water works (in shallow aquifer) due to imposed pressure signals."
