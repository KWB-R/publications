abstract: "A study is conducted to determine the relevance of micropollutants in urban stormwater runoff. To evaluate for the first time city-wide annual loads of stormwater-based micropollutants entering urban surface waters, an event-based, one-year monitoring program was set up in separate storm sewers in Berlin. Monitoring points were selected in 5 catchments of different urban structures (old building areas <1930, newer building areas >1950, single houses with gardens, roads >7500 vehicles/day and commercial areas) to consider catchment-specific differences. Storm events of different characteristics were sampled up to four hours during different seasons by automatic samplers triggered by flow meters. Volume-proportional samples (one composite sample per event) were analysed for a set of 100 parameters including 85 organic micropollutants (e.g. flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides/biocides, PAH), heavy metals and standard parameters. So far (70/88 samples), 60 organic micropollutants were at least once detected in stormwater runoff of the investigated catchment types. Concentrations were highest for phthalates with average concentrations of 13 µg/L for diisodecyl phthalate. For heavy metals, concentrations were highest for zinc (average: 950 µg/L). Results also showed catchment-specific differences for many compounds as well as seasonal differences for selected pollutants which can be used to improve micropollutant strategies and potentially prevent loads at the source."
