abstract = "Within the EU-funded demonstration project 'Sanitation Concepts for the Separate Treatment of Urine, Faeces and Greyweater' (SCST), initiated, financed, and coordinated by Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin), Berliner Wasserbetriebe and Veolia Water the Institute of Wastewater Management and Water Protection of Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) investigated processes for resource recovery and elimination of pharmaceutical residues from separate collected human urine. The main processes for resource recovery were steam stripping for nitrogen extraction and vacuum evaporation for volume reduction and obtaining highly concentrated nutrient solutions. The processes precipitation, crystallization, and adsorption, were used for nutrient recovery as follow-up techniques. The effect of steam stripping and evaporation on the reduction of PhaR was investigated, as well as the effect of the additional processes UVCradiation, ozonation."
