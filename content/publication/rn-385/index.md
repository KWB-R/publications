abstract = "The effect of combined sewer overflow (CSO) control measures should be validated during operation based on monitoring of CSO activity and subsequent comparison with (legal) requirements. However, most CSO monitoring programs have been started only recently and therefore no long-term data is available for reliable efficiency control. A method is proposed that focuses on rainfall data for evaluating the effectiveness of CSO control measures. It is applicable if a sufficient time-series of rainfall data and a limited set of data on CSO discharges are available. The method is demonstrated for four catchments of the Berlin combined sewer system. The analysis of the 2000â€“2007 data shows the effect of CSO control measures, such as activation of in-pipe storage capacities within the Berlin system. The catchment, where measures are fully implemented shows less than 40% of the CSO activity of those catchments, where measures have not yet or not yet completely been realised."
