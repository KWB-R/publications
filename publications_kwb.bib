  Title = {Review of promising Methods for Phosphorus Recovery and Recycling from Wastewater},
  Volume = {Band 763},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {To sustain good harvests, each year more than one million tonnes of mineral phosphorus have to be imported to the European Union (van Dijk et al., unpublished data), while the potential to recover and recycle this essential resource remains untapped or is just inefficiently used as in the case of sewage sludge, manure and food waste. In recent years various technical solutions have been developed to recover phosphorus providing mineral compounds suitable as raw material for fertiliser production or even as ready-to-use fertiliser. Regarding the implementation of these technologies, operational benefits for plant operators like the water utilities in the case of P recovery from wastewater and/or sewage sludge are the strongest argument for their market penetration. Without the provision of direct operational benefits, implementation needs to be motivated or even enforced by suitable and reliable policies. In order to realise a circular economy, it is important not just to focus on the recovery itself. The recovered materials need to match the requirements and needs of their intended users. Therefore, full value-chain solutions have to be promoted instead of isolated technology-focused approaches. Following our principles of sustainability and resource efficiency, the assessment of innovations must also include their environmental impact. This review provides an overview of recently developed and promising technologies for phosphorus recovery from wastewater and discusses aspects regarding their wide-spread application, along with their limitations. It will focus on recovery and recycling from sewage sludge. Not only the technologies themselves, also the recovered materials and their valorisation options are addressed. Results of the EU FP7 funded project P-REX entitled 'Sustainable sewage sludge management fostering phosphorus recovery and energy efficiency' and other recent initiatives will be included. Since innovation always needs an enabling environment for market penetration, barriers set by the existing legal framework and measures to resolve them will be reviewed. Finally, Goethe's words are true more than ever: 'Knowing is not enough, we must apply! Willing is not enough, we must do!'},

  Title = {Von Daten zu Prognosen: Neue Ansätze für die strategische Kanalsanierungsplanung},
  Volume = {68},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {German: In den vergangenen Jahren hat sich die Datenlage zum Zustand der Abwasserkanalisation und zur Wirkung unterschiedlicher Sanierungsverfahren stetig verbessert. Basierend auf diesen Erkenntnissen wurden durch das Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin und die Berliner Wasserbetriebe Prognosemodelle zur Bewertung unterschiedlicher Sanierungsszenarien sowie zur Lokalisierung schadhafter Kanäle entwickelt. Die vorliegende Studie zeigt den Weg von Bestands- und Zustandsdaten des Kanalnetzes zu einem an die lokalen Randbedingungen angepassten Simulationswerkzeug für die strategische Kanalsanierungsplanung. Dabei werden Methoden zur modellgestützten Ergänzung von Datenlücken sowie die entwickelten Modellkomponenten für Kanalalterung und -sanierung vorgestellt. Darüber hinaus werden Ergebnisse ausgewählter Sanierungsszenarien und die wichtigsten Prognoseunsicherheiten diskutiert. Der entwickelte Ansatz unterstützt die Kanalsanierungs- und Investitionsplanung von Kommunen und hilft, den Zustand der Abwasserinfrastruktur langfristig zu erhalten oder zu verbessern.},

  Title = {Micropollutants in urban stormwater runoff of different land uses},
  Volume = {13},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {The main aim of this study was a survey of micropollutants in stormwater runoff of Berlin (Germany) and its dependence on land-use types. In a one-year monitoring program, event mean concentrations were measured for a set of 106 parameters, including 85 organic micropollutants (e.g., flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides/biocides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)), heavy metals and standard parameters. Monitoring points were selected in five catchments of different urban land-use types, and at one urban river. We detected 77 of the 106 parameters at least once in stormwater runoff of the investigated catchment types. On average, stormwater runoff con-tained a mix of 24 µg L-1 organic micropollutants and 1.3 mg L-1 heavy metals. For organic micropol-lutants, concentrations were highest in all catchments for the plasticizer diisodecyl phthalate. Concentrations of all but five parameters showed significant differences among the five land-use types. While major roads were the dominant source of traffic-related substances such as PAH, each of the other land-use types showed the highest concentrations for some substances (e.g., flame retardants in commercial area, pesticides in catchment dominated by one family homes). Comparison with environmental quality standards (EQS) for surface waters shows that 13 micropollutants in storm-water runoff and 8 micropollutants in the receiving river exceeded German quality standards for receiving surface waters during storm events, highlighting the relevance of stormwater inputs for urban surface waters. © 2021 by the authors.
