  Abstract = {The Berlin Centre of Competence for Water organised, together with the International Water Association, the 2nd National Young Water Professionals Conference in Germany. This event was held on 4-5 June 2007 in Berlin and was following up on the first NYWP conference organised in Aachen in October 2005. It provided a forum for young researchers and professionals working in the membrane sector of the wastewater industry to present their work and meet their peers. The conference consisted on formal presentation of papers and posters, and an exchange with water industry professionals providing information on water career opportunities in Germany. This event was an initiative of “MBR-Network”, the European cluster on the membrane bioreactor technology, gathering about 50 European and international companies and institutions within the four FP6 projects Amedeus, Eurombra, MBR-Train and Puratreat (more info at www.mbrnetwork.eu). The technical program of the conference consisted mainly of contributions from German and international young water professionals including students, recent graduates and other professionals under the age of 35. This book contains most of the papers and posters which were presented at the Conference.},

  Title = {Demonstration of a planning instrument for integrated and impact based CSO control under climate change conditions in Berlin},
  Year = {2013},
  Abstract = {Combined sewer overflows (CSO) after heavy rainfall can cause acute depletions of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Berlin River Spree. Further aggravation of ecological deficits can be expected from global climate change. A planning instrument for CSO impact assessment under different sewer management and climate conditions has been developed at Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin. It couples the sewer model InfoWorks CS, the river water quality model Hydrax/QSim and an impact assessment tool. The planning instrument was validated for the years 2010 and 2011. Simulation results for the critical parameters discharge and DO concentrations in the Berlin River Spree agree well with measurements. Although not all observed DO deficits can be simulated accurately, the very good representation of processes related to the oxygen budget allows assessing relative changes in boundary conditions, e.g. from climate change or different CSO control strategies. The conducted scenario analysis indicates that the coupled sewer-rivermodel reacts sensitively to changes in boundary conditions (temperature, rainfall, storage volume and other CSO control strategies, etc.). Based on the simulation year 2007 – representing an extreme year with regards to CSO volume and critical conditions in the river – sewer rehabilitation measures planned to be implemented until 2020 are predicted to reduce total CSO volumes by 17% and discharged pollutant loads by 21 - 31%. The frequency of critical DO conditions for the most sensitive local fish species will decrease by one third. For a further improvement of water quality after the year 2020, the reduction of impervious surfaces emerges as a very effective management strategy where feasible. A reduction of the impervious connected area by 20% results in a decrease in the frequency of critical DO conditions by another third. The studied increase in surface air and water temperature as part of the climate change scenarios leads to a significant aggravation of DO stress due to background pollution in the Berlin River Spree, while acute DO depletions after CSO are barely affected. However, changes in rain intensity have a considerable effect on CSO volumes, pollutant loads and the frequency of critical DO concentrations. A general reduction of discharged pollutant loads by 60% based on the sewer status 2020 can prevent critical DO conditions in the Berlin River Spree, even for the exceptionally rain intense year 2007. A detailed analysis of river processes after CSO, has shown that the biodegradation of organic carbon compounds is the most important contributor to acute DO depletions in the Berlin River Spree. An additional impairment of DO conditions is caused by the inflow of oxygen free CSO spill water and suspended solids into the Berlin River Spree. In this report, CSO impacts under different management strategies or climate change conditions are assessed only for a part of the Berlin combined sewer system (although the main part) and for one exemplary year. An extension of the planning instrument to the entire combined sewer system would enable to evaluate the full impact of measures. For a robust prediction of future CSO impacts it is also recommended to test different simulation periods or conduct long-term simulations.},

  Title = {D4.1 Web-based real-time monitoring and control capabilities. Development and implementation of a web-based tool for the calculation of groundwater hydraulic residence time},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {Subsurface travel time from the area of recharge to the point of abstraction during MAR is a critical parameter to ensure sufficient attenuation for hygienic parameters and other undesired substances. A new simulation tool has been developed by the SMART-Control project partners KWB and TUD for determination of groundwater hydraulic residence time (HRT) using seasonal temperature fluctuations observed in recharge water and MAR recovery wells. This tool represents a proxy for quick, costs-effective and reliable control of travel time during aquifer passage. Time series of seasonal temperature measurements observed in surface water and abstraction wells can be fitted to sinusoidal functions. Peak values represented as local maxima and local minima and turning points from the fitted sinusoidal curves are used for the approximation of travel times between surface water and abstraction well. The calculated values are adjusted by a thermal retardation factor. The developed tool is userfriendly and offers the possibility to use existing hystorical temperature measurements as well as online sensor data. Data acquisition is resolved through the internal connectivity with other web-tools developed within the SMART-Control project, providing thus an integrated simulation environment.},

  Title = {D5.2 Real-time observation platform at MAR scheme in Berlin-Spandau, Germany Online estimation of groundwater hydraulic residence time and advanced microbial monitoring using flow-through cytometry},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {This report summarizes the work for monitoring of hydraulic residence time (HRT) carried out at the Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) site Berlin-Spandau waterworks. The newly installed monitoring system consists of realtime online sensor data and evaluation algorithms implemented as a web-based software tool. The combination of online data with processing tools allows time-efficient HRT evaluation. Apart from HRT estimations, the monitoring also included measurements by flow-through cytometry (FCM), meta-genomic DNA sequencing and classical microbial cultivation-based analysis. FCM cell counting allows to quantitatively detect microbial cells after staining with a DNA-binding fluorescent dye. The aim of FCM measurements was to gain insights on microbial dynamics along the flow path from the infiltration basin to the abstraction well. The FCM device was installed to measure in the infiltration basin, groundwater observation well and abstraction well in a continuously flowing sampling line that allowed for automatic and continuous monitoring in water. Microbial indicators of viruses, bacteria and protozoa were sampled and analysed by classical cultivation-based methods in parallel to the FCM measurements. The combination of FCM with cultivation-based methods aimed to establish an indicative reference cell count representing a hygienically safe water. The high-frequency flow cytometry data revealed decreasing order of total cell counts from surface water in the infiltration basin water to groundwater in the abstraction well. The fairly constant measurements in the abstraction well may allow to use FCM fingerprinting as a fast monitoring tool in combination with cultivation based methods. However, long-term measurements of FCM for at least 6 months are recommended to assess seasonal fluctuation in both source water and groundwater. Water samples were in addition characterised by DNA sequencing enabling a complete "meta genomic" analysis and taxonomic profiling including bacterial, archaea, viral, eukaryotic DNA. The DNA sequencing in combination with FCM measurements showed that total cell counts decreased along the flow path while the biodiversity increased.},

  Title = {Assessment of Full-Scale Indirect Potable Water Reuse in El Port de la Selva, Spain},
  Volume = {13},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {In 2015, the town of El Port de la Selva in Spain implemented soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) using tertiary treated wastewater effluents to replenish the local potable aquifer. This study evaluated the initial phase of this indirect potable water reuse system including a characterization of hydraulic conditions in the aquifer and monitoring of microbial contaminants and 151 chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). The combined treatment resulted in very low abundances of indicator bacteria, enteric viruses and phages in the monitoring wells after three days of infiltration and a reduction of antibiotic microbial resistance to background levels of local groundwater. After tertiary treatment, 94 CECs were detected in the infiltration basin of which 15 chemicals exceeded drinking water thresholds or health-based monitoring trigger levels. Although SAT provided an effective barrier for many chemicals, 5 CECs were detected above health-based threshold levels in monitoring wells after short hydraulic retention times. However, additional attenuation is expected due to dilution prior to abstraction via downstream drinking water wells and during granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration, which was recently installed to mitigate residual CECs. Overall, the results demonstrate that indirect potable water reuse can be a reliable option for smaller communities, if related risks from microbial and chemical contaminants are adequately addressed by tertiary treatment and subsequent SAT, providing sufficient hydraulic retention times for pathogen decay and CEC removal.},

  Title = {D2.1 Matrix of risks and remediation measures  - Risks and remediation measures at different stages of MAR site development. Deliverable 2.1},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {The types and objectives to apply managed aquifer recharge (MAR) are manifold and so are the risks that can arise during the planning, implementation and operation of a MAR facility. In general, operational, regulatory, business, human health, and environmental risks can occur and should be identified already during the planning and implementation stage to apply preventive measures and secure the safe and realibale operation of a MAR facility. This report represents risk assessment based on recommendations of international guidelines (AlcaldeSanz and Gawlik, 2017; NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008; WHO, 2009, 2011) at six MAR sites which are at different stages of development. Three case studies are at the feasibility or pilot stage: two ASR systems in João Pessoa and Recife, Brazil and one induced bank filtration site at the Beberibe River in Brazil, and three case studies at the operational stage: one SAT system in the Ezousa catchment in Cyprus, and two infiltration basin systems in Hyères, France (Aquarenova site) and Berlin-Spandau, Germany. The entrylevel assessment according to the Australian guidelines (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2009) has been conducted for the feasibility or pilot scale schemes For fully operational MAR schemes, in addition to the entry-level assessment, the degree of difficulty assessment and the maximal risk assessment were carried out. At all stages of site development, risk assessment helps to identify and characterize potential hazards that may cause risks to human health and the environment. This report may be used to assist in clarifying which actions or further investigations are required to identify and reduce the uncertainty of risks and to implement remediation measures if necessary. In addition, this report intends to show how sitespecific hazards have been assessed to varying degrees depending upon the level of risk assessed at each project development stage.},

  University = {Technische Universität Berlin},
  Abstract = {In this master thesis the redissolution and recovery of phosphorus (P) and other valuable materials from Ruhleben sewage sludge ash (R-SSA) with HCl and H2SO4 was investigated using experimental laboratory tests. The parameters acid amount, solid liquid ratio (s/l ratio) and reaction time were varied and their influence on the redissolution of Ca, P, Al, Fe and SO4 was measured. Results showed that HCl(37%) resolved 91 ± 4 % P with an acid amount of 4 mL on 5 g R-SSA, a s/l ratio of 1:20 (acid concentration 0.46 mol/L) and a reaction time of 60 min. H2SO4(30%) on the other hand resolved 89 ± 3 % P at 6 mL on 5 g R-SSA, a s/l ratio of 1:10 (acid concentration 0.6 mol/L) and a reaction time of 60 min. Ca and SO4 showed very good redissolution of up to 100 % with HCl. The Ca redissolution with H2SO4 is clearly below that of HCl and is 63%. Al resolved to a lesser extent and reaches 65% with H2SO4 and 53% with HCl. Fe shows the lowest redissolution of 14% with HCl and 12% with H2SO4. The H2SO4 leaching experiments also showed that it is possible to separate the gypsum from the R-SSA if the leaching liquid is separated from the R-SSA after short contact times with H2SO4. The contact time, the acid amount and the s/l ratio have a big impact on the precipitation. It was possible to recover 75% of the total amount of gypsum that can be precipitated from R-SSA. In addition to this, the gypsum-free leaching liquid was then added to the R-SSA again which had already been leached, in order to dissolve P. There was no loss of P redissolution when the gypsum was extracted. This approach could not be observed in any other study. Based on the results, a recovery of 2,114 ± 130 t P/a with HCl and 2062 ± 130 t P/a with H2SO4 are possible if an amount of 30,000 t R-SSA/a is treated, which are forecasted for Berlin in the future. Since the redissolution of 91 ± 4% P requires an acid amount of 946 kg HCl(37%)/t R-SSA, this would result in an absolute annual acid requirement of 28,380 t HCl(37%) for 30,000 t R-SSA/a. H2SO4 experiments showed that 725 kg H2SO4(90%)/t R-SSA would be required for 89 ± 3% P redissolution, resulting in an absolute acid requirement of 21,750 t H2SO4(90%). Since H2SO4 has a lower consumption due to the higher concentration, is the cheaper acid of the two and has the possibility of recovering gypsum, H2SO4 would be preferred for leaching R-SSA from an economic point of view. In addition, about 75% of the gypsum can be precipitated with H2SO4, which corresponds to a quantity of 255 kg of gypsum(dry)/t R-SSA. At 30,000 t R-SSA/a, this results in an annual amount of 6630 ± 51 t gypsum that can be recovered.},

  University = {Technische Universität Berlin},
  Abstract = {Vacuum degasification (VD) of ammonia from waste streams and subsequent production of nitrogen fertilizer can be one element of the effort towards closing the nitrogen (N) cycle and thus avoiding emissions harmful to the environment. This master’s thesis comprises a literature research for suitable substrates and laboratory experiments for the optimization of a design and experimental design of a VD pilot plant for ammonia recovery. Eight streams among the top 20 food waste streams in Europe and their associated streams, all digestates from digestion or co-digestion of animal waste streams, agricultural digestates and manures were identified as suitable substrates for N-recovery with VD. During 120 min of VD at pH 9.0, 190 mbar and 60 °C a total ammonia-N (TAN) removal rate of 0.81 ± 0.03 was achieved with an NaOH load of about 80 ml (L substrate)-1 in biogas digestate. The TAN removal rate during VD at 190 mbar and 60°C was dependent on pH with a dose response function. For efficient ammonia removal pH = 9.0 was necessary. Evidence for an ammonia volatilization inhibition at pH = 8.5 not explicable by the ammonia dissociation was found. At 158 % of the boiling pressure, 69 % of the TAN removal rate at boiling pressure was reached. Air stripping the hot substrate for 60 min lowered the NaOH load for maintaining pH 9.0 during VD by 30 %. Electrical conductivity (EC) and pH during the degasification treatment did not correlate. Alkaline hydrolysis could be the reason for pH decrease during VD at pH 9.5. In the pilot plant a pH sensor and a possibility to adjust the pH continuously should be installed. The pH for VD experiments at 60°C should be in the range 8.75–9.5. Pressures below the boiling pressure should not be excluded. Experiments with CO2 stripping should be conducted to exhaust the potential for NaOH saving.},

  Abstract = {Against the background of resource conservation, many recycled products have been developed in context of phosphorus recovery. Due to their properties some of them can be used directly as fertilizers. Phosphorus is subject to complex sorption and precipitation processes in the soil, which have a significant influence on solubility and plant availability. Therefore, in this work comparative studies on the fixation of phosphorus of recycled and conventional fertilizers in soil and experiments on solution equilibrium and solution kinetics were carried out. For the investigation of the solution equilibrium and the solution kinetics, batch and pH-stat experiments were conducted. The determined concentrations and pH values were compared with model simulations in Visual MINTEQ. To investigate the fixation of phosphorus in the soil, 8-week incubation experiments were carried out, in which soils of different properties were mixed with a respective fertilizer per batch. For the experiments two struvite products (Crystal Green and Berliner Pflanze), a thermally processed ash (Ash Dec), a rock phosphate (Dolophos 26) and the conventional fertilizers TSP and DAP were selected. Solution equilibrium of all fertilizers in water was achieved after seven days of shaking. Conventional fertilizers showed significantly higher P solubilities in water than recycled fertilizers. Because there was a very high level of agreement with the Visual MINTEQ model simulations, the software is a good tool for first orientation of the dissolution behavior of different P fertilizer products. In terms of solution kinetics, the lowest half-life was observed for struvite, with an average of 9.5 minutes. While the half-life of Dolophos increased from pH 5 to 7, no pH dependence was observed in the dissolution kinetics of the recycled fertilizers. In the incubation experiment, a higher decrease in plant-available phosphorus with conventional fertilizers tended to be observed toward the end of the experiment. Although this could be an indication of increased fixation in soil, this cannot be attributed only to chemical sorption and precipitation processes due to the increased microbial activity. Therefore, under these experimental conditions no clear statements can be made on the fixation of phosphorus of conventional and recycled P-fertilizers in the soil. Further investigations are required here.},

  Abstract = {With the new sewage sludge ordinance from 2017, phosphorus recovery becomes obligatory for large sewage treatment plant operators. Within the last year, the interpretation of this ordinance due to the exact wording has changed. As an example, a process aiming to recover phosphorus within the sewage treatment plant from waste water or sludge before the sludge is legally understood as waste. Therefore, a benchmark of 20 g Phosphorus (P)/kg dry matter (DM) is foreseen. However, this benchmark is an obstacle to increasing energy efficiency and sludge reduction, since carbon and dry matter is transferred into biogas in anaerobic digestion. Normally, raw sludge has a phosphorus content around 20 g P/kg DM, while digested sludge has a phosphorus content of about 35 g P/kg DM. The paper shows estimations of different full-scale combinations targeting phosphorus and advanced energy recovery and the resulting phosphorus content in sewage sludge per kg DM. Furthermore, this paper discusses the legal framework regarding phosphorus recovery from ash based on the sewage sludge ordinance, the national fertilizer regulation, the European Union fertilizing product regulation and the European Union feed/fodder regulation. The author concludes, that the legal framework is not explained properly to sewage treatment plant operators, which leads to confusions. Several questionable paragraphs and their wording should be addressed in future regulation amendments. Finally, there should be a regulatory need to establish phosphorus recovery from demand side (fertilizer industry, farmers) and not only from supplier side (sewage treatment plants). Because otherwise products must be produced, whereby no actual market for these products is established.},

  Title = {Evaluation von Verfahrensoptionen zur Senkung von Energiebedarf und Treibhausgasemissionen der Berliner Kläranlagen – Abschlussbericht zum Projekt E-VENT (BENE#1158-B5-O)},
  Year = {2021},
  Abstract = {Im Projekt E-VENT wurden innovative Verfahren der kommunalen Abwasserreinigung und Klärschlammbehandlung untersucht, um damit den Energieverbrauch von Klärwerken und die damit verbundenen Emissionen von Treibhausgasen (THG) zu senken. Nach einem Screening verschiedener Technologien wurden dazu Labor- und Pilotversuche zur thermischen Hydrolyse von Klärschlamm und zur Abwasserbehandlung mit granuliertem Belebtschlamm im Nereda®Verfahren durchgeführt. Aufbauend auf den Versuchsergebnissen wurden für ein Berliner Klärwerk verschiedene Varianten für einen zukünftigen Neubau modelliert und bewertet, um das Potential der innovativen Verfahren zur Senkung von THG-Emissionen unter den spezifischen Randbedingungen in Berlin abzuschätzen. Abschließend wurden auch die Investitions- und Betriebskosten der neuen Verfahren mit einer konventionellen Referenzvariante verglichen. Die Versuche zur thermischen Hydrolyse zeigen, dass der Faulgasertrag aus dem Klärschlamm damit deutlich erhöht werden kann (bis zu +26%). Gleichzeitig erhöht sich aber auch die Rückbelastung des Faulschlammzentrats mit Phosphor, Stickstoff und refraktären organischen Stoffen. Neben dem erhöhten Aufwand zur Behandlung des Zentrats kann vor allem der refraktäre organische Anteil die Ablaufqualität der Klärwerke deutlich verschlechtern, besonders bei Thermo-Druck-Hydrolyse. Bei thermo-alkalischer Hydrolyse konnte im Pilotversuch ein Mehrgasertrag von +19% im Jahresmittel sowie eine moderate Belastung des entstehenden Zentrats gezeigt werden, das die Ablaufwerte des Klärwerks nicht signifikant verschlechtert. Im Pilotversuch zum Nereda®-Verfahren wurde ein stabiler Betrieb mit granuliertem Belebtschlamm erreicht, der eine gute biologische Reinigungsleistung für Phosphor und Stickstoff zeigte. Die hohen Anforderungen an die Ablaufwerte konnten jedoch nicht zuverlässig erreicht werden. Wie auch im konventionellen Belebtschlammverfahren ist dabei die Verfügbarkeit von Kohlenstoff (CSB/N-Verhältnis) ein möglicher limitierender Faktor für die biologischen Prozesse und die erreichbare Ablaufqualität. Darüber hinaus wurde ein erhöhter Anteil von Feststoffen im Ablauf des Nereda®-Verfahrens festgestellt, der zur Erreichung der vorgegebenen Zielwerte eine Nachreinigung über Filtration erforderlich macht. Vor einer großtechnischen Umsetzung sind daher weitere Untersuchungen in größerem Maßstab notwendig, um die zuverlässige Einhaltung der geforderten Überwachungswerte zu prüfen. Die Messung von Lachgas ergab relativ hohe Emissionsfaktoren dieses starken THG für die Nereda®-Pilotanlage. Die Bewertung der Verfahren für einen zukünftigen Neubau des Klärwerks Stahnsdorf zeigen, dass die innovativen Verfahren die Energiebilanz gegenüber einer konventionellen Referenz weiter verbessern können. Dabei werden die möglichen Vorteile einer thermo-alkalischen Hydrolyse im Faulgasertrag durch den Mehraufwand auf dem Klärwerk und auch durch geringere Energierückgewinnung in der Klärschlammentsorgung im Modell ausgeglichen. Beim Nereda®Verfahren sinkt der Verbrauch an Strom und Fällmitteln und verbessert so die Energiebilanz und senkt die damit verbundenen Emission von Treibhausgasen. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass wichtige Eingangsdaten weiter validiert werden sollten, um zu einer abschließenden Bewertung dieser Verfahren zu kommen. Die Schätzung der Investitions- und Betriebskosten ergab, dass die innovativen Verfahren Kostenvorteile bieten können. Insgesamt zeigte das Projekt, dass die hier untersuchten innovativen Verfahren ein Potential zur Senkung der THG-Emissionen der Abwasserreinigung bieten. Für den betrachteten Neubau des Klärwerk Stahnsdorf konnten dieser THG-Fußabdruck um bis zu 72% gesenkt werden, was einer Einsparung von 3700 Tonnen CO2Äquivalenten entspricht. Bei einer zukünftigen Einführung solcher innovativen Verfahren ist jedoch immer die zuverlässige Einhaltung der vorgegebenen Ablaufwerte als Primärziel der Abwasserreinigung zu garantieren und dafür in großtechnischem Maßstab zu überprüfen.},
