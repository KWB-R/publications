  Title = {Pilot study of thermal alkaline pretreatment of waste activated sludge: Seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and impact on dewaterability and refractory COD},
  Volume = {182},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Thermal alkaline pretreatment (TAP) of waste activate sludge (WAS) was carried out in pilot-scale over a year to investigate its seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and its impact on dewaterability, sludge liquor quality and formation of soluble refractory COD (sCODref). Temperature of TAP was set at 65–70 °C and pH was increased by initial dosing of sodium hydroxide [NaOH] (50% w/w, 1–2.5 mL/L sludge) as alkali agent following 2–2.5 h reaction time. Pilot digesters were fed with primary sludge (PS) and hydrolyzed WAS (HWAS) and compared to a reference digester fed with PS and untreated WAS. Biogas yield increase due to TAP of WAS showed a sinusoidal trend throughout the year with maximum in summer (+42%), minimum in winter (+3%) and average of +20%, indicating a strong seasonal effect on TAP efficiency. Ammonium [NH4+-N], orthophosphate [PO43--P] and sulphate [SO42-] in sludge liquor increased by 34.6%, 17.0% and 21.6% with TAP, respectively. Centrifugation tests showed no significant difference in dewaterability of both digestates with respect to total solids of sludge cake. Normalized capillary suction time of digestate increased due to TAP, indicating a lower capability for water release. Furthermore, detected sCODref after batch aerobic biodegradation tests showed an increase of 30.3% with TAP. Hence, implementation of TAP of WAS in full-scale will potentially lead to an increase of 0.8–1.1 mg/L of sCODref in effluent of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Berlin. In conclusion, TAP of WAS leads to increase in biogas production with a slighter negative impact on effluent COD quality than high-temperature thermal hydrolysis.},

  Abstract = {In order to reduce energy requirements of wastewater treatment plants, sludge disintegration in form of thermochemical hydrolysis is considered as an alternative method for sludge treat-ment. It is supposed to improve biogas yield by means of improved biodegradation, thus in-creasing energy production. However, accumulation of persistent organic matter has been re-ported as a result of thermochemical hydrolysis. To examine the effects, thermochemical hy-drolysis of excess sludge and thickened excess sludge has been carried out in the laboratory in the temperature range of 50 °C to 90 °C with a base addition of 0,02 gNaOH/gTS to 0,08 gNaOH/gTS. The treated sludge was then analysed in biomethane potential tests regard-ing its biogas yield and in Zahn-Wellens-Tests concerning the accumulation of persistent or-ganic matter. Due to complications in both experiments a methodology which solved these issues had to be developed first. Only the experiments done after the completion of this meth-odology were evaluated. The biomethane potential test resulted in an increase of biogas yield in nearly all tests. Optimal conditions were found at 70 °C and with 0,08 gNaOH/gTS with an increase of 26 % in biogas yield to 272 NmL/g oTR. Only one Zahn-Wellens-Test could be fully evaluated due to foaming problems. The treated sludge showed an increased formation of refractory COD from the initial VS of the samples. The conversion factor rose with an increased base addition. 3,15 % of VS of the untreated sample were converted into refractory COD, whereas it was 5,15 % for the sample treated at 70 °C and with 0,08 gNaOH/gTS. To obtain generalizable statements for wastewater treatment plants, foaming problems should be re-duced and further experiments carried out to verify the found results.},

  Abstract = {Thermal-pressure hydrolysis and thermal-alkaline hydrolysis of secondary sludge, from the wastewater treatment plant Waßmannsdorf, were compared based on the physical changes of the treated sludges. For this purpose, seven parameters were determined for investigation. These were: Viscosity, particle size distribution, microscopic images, capillary suction time (CST), TR after the laboratory centrifuge test, zeta potential and foaming potential. To measure these parameters, methods were developed and then applied respectively to sludges from both treatments. The thermal-pressure hydrolysis performed better than the thermal-alkaline hydrolysis in each parameter investigation. In particular, the dewaterability of the sludges after digestion, which represents an important cost factor in sewage plant operation, could be improved by thermal-pressure hydrolysis, but not by thermal-alkaline hydrolysis.},

  Abstract = {The focus of this study investigation was laid on the plant-specific applicability of a NaOH and thermal pretreatment of activated sludge AS with following mesophilic digestion and the influence on the biomethane potential BMP. Firstly, the hydrolysis of activated sludge from the granular sludge process of the Nereda technology, which differs from conventional activated sludge in terms of sludge formation, sludge stabilization, and sludge age, was investigated for the first time. A higher dose of NaOH (0.02 - 0.08 g NaOH per gVS, 70 °C) raised the COD and phosphate degree of digestion and the digester gas yield by 22 - 47 %. Different hydrolysis temperatures (50 - 90 °C, 0.05 g NaOH per gVS) also increased the sludge parameters. However, the BMP only enhanced by 12 % at temperatures higher than 70 °C. With increasing hydrolysis temperature, the digestion time was reduced by 2 - 5 days. Despite the process-related differences between conventional AS (from the Stahnsdorf wastewater treatment plant) and AS from the granular sludge processing, comparable results were obtained in the BMP test, with and without pretreatment. Due to a lack of time, the experiments could only be carried out once or twice. As there are currently no further experience and references on this subject, additional attempts for achieving significant results will follow. In the second part, sludges from the Waßmannsdorf sewage treatment plant were used. Laboratory tests have shown that primary sludge has no influence on the digestion process. The calculated BMP of 176.5 NmL/gCSB deviates by 3% from the value of 181.9 NmL/gCSB measured in the laboratory test. It is directly related to the ratio of the used sludges. Hydrolysis according to PONDUS (70 °C; 2 h; 2.5 mL NaOH 50 % per L AS) at laboratory revealed a comparable influence on the sludge parameters as with hydrolysis on a pilot scale. During the BMP test, the laboratory sample achieved a maximum gas yield of 143 NmL/gCSB, which is a 9 % higher BMP in comparison to the pilot sample with 132 NmL/gCSB. The laboratory results can, therefore, be transferred to the pilot scale, so that the effects of changes in operation can be reliably assessed by cost, time and effort saving laboratory tests. This thesis was written within the framework of the project “Evaluation of process options for the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of Berlin sewage treatment plants" at the Berlin Centre of Competence for Water.},

  Title = {Assessment of N2O emissions from an SBR plant with aerobic granular sludge technology on pilot scale},
  Type = {Master Thesis},
  Year = {2020},
  University = {Technische Universität Berlin},
  Abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are evolving towards a more sustainable manner, by which not only the effluent quality and operational costs but also the greenhouse gases (GHG) potential is incorporated into the assessment inventory. GHG emissions from the WWTPs include CH4, CO2 and N2O, of which the N2O is of special interest due to 265-fold CO2-equivalent. Thus, even a low amount of N2O is undesired. Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a promising biological nutrient removal technology due to considerable structural and microbiological distinctions compared with conventional activated sludge (CAS) flocs, leading to huge improvements of carbon footprint saving. Nevertheless, the N2O formation from the AGS reactor is likely higher than that from the CAS, in terms of sequence batch reactor (SBR) configuration and inherent complex mechanism. In addition, there wasn’t any long-term monitoring campaign on the AGS reactor focusing on N2O emissions so far.This study focusses on a N2O emission online monitoring campaign, which was carried out in a Nereda® AGS reactor treating domestic wastewater from the Berlin region, lasted more than 6 months, including two different phases, namely feeding with pre-treated and raw wastewater after aerated sand trap and 2mm sieve box. The off-gas was sucked from the top of the SBR reactor and measured with online gas analyzer. Then the emission factor (EF) was calculated based on the correlated influent nitrogen load, which was converted from the influent NH4-N concentration by fixed ratio of 0.8. During the first phase, the EF was equal to 2.97%, while during the second phase, the EF was equal to 4.52%. Generally, the EF calculated in terms of both phases was 3.71%. Compared with other long-term campaigns based on CAS and SBR processes, higher GHG potentials could be induced, which also challenges the predominance of the AGS reactors from the perspective of minimizing GHG when only considering the energy consumption into scope. In-depth analysis indicated that the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway was the most likely over the monitoring course and EF calculated during main aeration incorporate negligible fraction of N2O produced from the pre-denitrification phase. Correlation test combining two specific time frames showed the moderate positive correlation between temperature and EF, which was in contrast to what has been assumed before but coincided with the inference from the micro-level analysis of our study. The weak negative correlation ship of COD/N ratio and EF was reported for each individual phase. Due to the insignificant impact from pre-denitrification and exclusion of the post-denitrification phase, it could not be considered as reliable. In terms of narrow range of DO and no accumulation of nitrite, the weak negative correlation ship of DO and EF could not infer to any further conclusion. In addition, it should be noted that some uncertainties may distract the reliability of our results. High resolution online measurement should be applied for the determination of off-gas flow, COD and TNb concentration, instead of correlation method or infrequent laboratory analysis. The detection of dissolved N2O along the course are needed to provide more insights about the N2O formation during the process and to distinguish the contribution between aerated phase and non-aeration phase. At last, more frequent monitoring of the significant precursor nitrite and hydroxylamine is demanded to figure out the dominant pathway for AGS reactors.},

  Abstract = {The objective of this work was to determine the effects of thermal-pressure hydrolysis (TPH) on dewatered secondary sludge (5-7 % DR) from the wastewater treatment plant Waßmannsdorf with regard to solubilisation properties, biogas production and the formation of refractory substances. In laboratory tests, the impact of the treatment temperature on the sludge due to the TPH was investigated by varying the treatment temperatures within the range of 130-170 °C with a constant hydrolysing time of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the effect of TPH (TTH: 140-170 °C; tTH: 30 min) on digested mixed sludge was studied to quantify the total biogas production of the “Degradation-Lysis-Degradation”-process (DLD). With increasing treatment temperatures (130-170 °C), the COD solubilisation of the hydrolysates was increased linearly up to 45 % which caused higher a biogas production and improved organic matter reduction rates during the anaerobic batch tests. An average methane yield of 212 L·(kg VSS)-1 was produced by the untreated secondary sludge. TPH caused an enhancement of the methane production of additional 17-27 % with the highest surplus observed at treatment temperatures of 170 °C. The organic matter degradation of 46.6 % in the untreated secondary sludge was 2.6 to 36.5 % higher in the hydrolysed sludges and increased with higher temperatures. TPH treatment of the secondary sludge caused formation of refractory COD, that has been measured in the digested sludge filtrate after 28 days of the aerobic degradation test. The organic matter of the untreated secondary sludge was found to be transformed to refractory COD up to 3 %. For the hydrolysed sludges (130-170 °C), the transformation of the organic compounds to refractory COD amounted, temperature-dependent, to 3.9-8.4 %. Raising the TPH treatment temperature from 160 to 170 °C, showed a sharp increase in refractory COD. In order to achieve high biogas yields with moderate loads of refractory compounds in the sludge water, a TPH-temperature of 150-160 °C is recommended. Applying the TPH to the DLD-configuration, hydrolysed sludges showed 20-30 % greater methane yields as well as 16-27 % higher biodegradation rates compared to the untreated digested sludge. At a treatment temperature of 170 °C of the digested sludge, 372 L·(kg VSS)-1 methane were produced with a organic matter reduction of 67.6 %. Comparing the test results of TDH at 170 °C and the Thermo-alkaline Hydrolysis (TaH) of secondary sludge, dosing 0,08 g NaOH·(g DR)-1 at a treatment temperature of 70 °C, the highest achievable methane yields were in the same range of approx. 270 L·(kg VSS)-1. TaH caused a 50 % lower refractory compound formation than TDH. However, the enhanced dewaterability of TDH treated sludge, compared to TaH treatment, provides cost-saving potential.},
